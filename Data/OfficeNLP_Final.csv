304,michael,you know what this is a colorfreezone here stanley i dont look at you as another race
305,mr brown,uh see this is what im talking about we dont have to pretend were colorblind
306,michael,exactly were not

314,michael,celebrate good times come on lets celebrate diversity right
315,mr brown,yes exactly now heres what were going to do ive noticed that
316,michael,you know what heres what were going to do why dont we go around and everybody everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually i will go last go
317,dwight,i have two white and indian
318,mr brown,actually id prefer not to start that way michael i would love to have your permission to run this session can i have your permission
319,michael,yes
320,mr brown,thank you very much and it would also help me if you were seated
321,michael,ok
322,mr brown,thank you ok now at the start of the session i had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace now what im going to do is choose one and were going to act it out
323,dwight,a few of the ground rules
324,michael,hey hey why dont you run it by me and ill run it by him
325,dwight,ok can we steer away from gay people
326,mr brown,um
327,dwight,im sorry its an orientation its not a race plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays soparadox
328,mr brown,well we only have an hour
329,dwight,i figured it would save time
330,michael,ok why dont we just defer to mr
331,mr brown,mr brown
332,michael,ah oh right ok first test i will not call you that
333,mr brown,well its my name its not a test ok um so looking through the cards ive noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident which is ironic because its the exact incident i was brought in here to respond to now how many of you are familiar with the chris rock routine very good ok
334,michael,how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and groundbreaking and then i go and do the exact same routine same comedic timing and people file a complaint to corporate is it because im white and chris is black
335,mr brown,so were going to reenact this with a more positive outcome
336,michael,i will play the chris rock guy i would like to see someone else pull this off
337,mr brown,well lets have someone who wasnt involved in the reenactment
338,michael,ok i will play guy listening
339,mr brown,great guy listening ok anyone else remember
340,kevin,i remember
341,mr brown,great youre the chris rock guy and youre guy listening
342,michael,ok
343,michael,kevin is a great guy hes a great accountant he is not much of an entertainer
344,kevin,basically there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people every time the one type wants to have a good time then the other type comes in and makes a real mess
345,michael,ok im sorry im sorry hes ruin hes butchering it could you just let me as chris rock every time every time black people want to have a good time some ignant ass bleep i take care of my kid
346,mr brown,wait a second

493,mr brown,yeah but its not appropriate this is not helpful as a memory aid
494,michael,i will give you a number of reasons why it is actually okay first incest is bad racism is bad no brainer right two incest were all a family right were all brothers and sisters racial message um number three and this is a fact the states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest okay and finally
495,mr brown,okay michael i just
496,michael,no no no no wait final one final one this is important the more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest literally

876,jim,no was that the hard way
877,dwight,i know you did
878,jim,well then why are you wasting everybody elses time interrogating them
879,dwight,well because i want to know who wrote those diseases down
880,jim,right
881,dwight,you want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down write this down
882,jim,okay
883,dwight,i jim halpert
884,jim,wait slow down
885,dwight,confess to health care fraud
886,jim,one second cause that sounds really good is jackass one word or two dwight sighs one right cause cause of the show its one
887,dwight,one word
888,michael,ive really learned from the greats the great improvisers drew carey ryan stiles uh the brady guy not so much hes more the signing wayne brady um robin williams oh man would i love to go headtohead with him oh that would be exciting as robin williams hi im mork from ork well im bork from spork nanoo nanoo jibelee baloobaloo as robin williams thats good morning vietnam well hello to you you know it would be god and you know what sometimes when im watching somebody like um like jay leno hell be half way through his step snaps his fingers and i will already be laughing at the punch line he hasnt even gotten to it he doesnt even know what it is it so its fun you know its fun having a mind that works like that that is just a few steps ahead of comedically ahead of like whats going on like ill watch tv and ill be watching a show and i will think oh i know someones gonna walk in here right now and say something funny and then they do or um i know theyll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down theres going to be some sort of insult and there is you know theres like oh youre god your butt is fat and i knew it i know its like i knew they were going to say that i knew they were gonna go there dont go there um but other you know its like uh you know leno um and letterman carson you know need i say more no
889,dwight,oh um jan wants you to call her
890,michael,were all going bowling
891,dwight,michael
892,michael,oh god dwight come on
893,dwight,i wanted to talk to you about the downsizing
894,michael,theres no downsizing
895,dwight,i but if there were id be protected as assistant regional manager
896,michael,assistant to the regional manager dwight
897,dwight,yeah so i dont have to worry
898,michael,look look look i talked to corporate about protecting the sales staff and they said they couldnt guarantee it if theres downsizing okay
899,michael,but theres no downsizing so just dont
900,dwight,bottom line do i need to be worried
901,michael,mmm mm mm maybe
902,michael,it looks like theres gonna be downsizing and its part of my job but blah i hate it i think the main difference between me and donald trump is that uh i get no pleasure out of saying the words youre fired as donald trump youre foired uh youre foired it just makes people sad and an office cant function that way no way as donald trump youre foired  i think if i had a catchphrase it would be youre hired and you can work here as long as you want but thats unrealistic so
903,dwight,its a real shame cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through watercooler gossip than through official memos which puts me at a disadvantage because i bring my own water to work
904,stanley,whyd you do this
905,dwight,i didnt do it what do you mean oh the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance so what do you guys hear whats the scuttlebutt
906,michael,get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott now i think i have had a little stroke of genius in that i have had my assistant pam smile pam i have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it not bad not bad at all all right and the birthday person is drum roll please here we go who is the birthday birthday person

929,michael,these are my partyplanning beeyatches pulled off an amazing s party last year off the hook

933,pam,it is her birthday
934,michael,mint chocolate chip thatd be good how about some mint chocolate chip
935,dwight,hey so listen i was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and i formed an alliance cause of the downsizing i think an alliance might be a good idea you know help each other out
936,dwight,do you want to form an alliance with me
937,jim,absolutely i do
938,dwight,good good excellent ok now we need to figure out whos vulnerable and whos protected
939,jim,at that moment i was so happy i mean everything dwight does annoys me
940,dwight,did you get your tickets
941,jim,to what
942,dwight,the gun show rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep
943,jim,and i spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him but only in ways that could get me arrested and then here he comes and he says no jim heres a way
944,dwight,theres one other thing and this is important lets keep this alliance totally a secret dont tell anyone
945,pam,an alliance
946,jim,oh yeah
947,pam,what does that even mean

2252,michael,tmi too much information i used to say dont go there but that is so lame now or you go girl or um when did wheres the beef that was like a long long time ago its funny how the shelf life of these things like how long they last like too much information probably came on the scene i mean i didnt hear it till like this month so its pretty recently um but you know theyre generally good for like no more than five or six years
2253,toby,yes thats true i have never won a dundie i am more than okay  with that
2254,kelly,i think im gonna share some cadillac fajitas with toby toby is so cute except he has that stupid kid
2255,angela,yes im the designated driver which is very important we need everyone to get home safely sighs but no one ever gives me gas money and people live all over its expensive
2256,dwight,scoffs like a gaggle of geese jibbering mockingly
2257,michael,all right we need something for kevin
2258,jim,mmmhmmm
2259,michael,what do we know about him hes an accountant
2260,jim,he plays guitar he likes naval history hes a bowler
2261,michael,talking over jim hes fat the fat accountant award
2262,jim,well you seem to have this under control
2263,jim,the weird part about this whole deal this that michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational i mean he puts more effort and time and commitment into the dundies than anything else he does all year which is probably why this branch will be downsized
2264,michael,i am the fat accountant
2265,dwight,michael i need to talk to you
2266,michael,here he is
2267,dwight,i just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies room wall
2268,michael,really what did they say for a good time call michael scott
2269,jim,good one
2270,dwight,uh no no no i think something bad maybe
2271,michael,why do you think that you just immediately go to that dwight why are you so negative why
2272,dwight,michael
2273,michael,i mean you just come in and youre just negative
2274,dwight,michael
2275,michael,and you just walk negatively
2276,michael,do you want me to find out what it says
2277,michael,yes
2278,dwight,by any means necessary
2279,michael,what does that even mean what are you what are you talking about
2280,dwight,its the ladies room
2281,michael,just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me but dont tell anybody that i have anything to do with it because if they ask me i will say that you are crazy
2282,michael,thank you you wont regret this michael
2283,jim,what award would you like to give dwight
2284,michael,i hadnt planned on including him
2285,jim,okay
2286,michael,kevin
2287,dwight,it hasnt always been easy being a whistleblower when i was in school the kids would call me a tattletale or a snitch or a worm so i really identify with those women from enron i wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me but they never wrote back i guess theyre all married
2288,dwight,angela its simple just tell me what the bathroom wall says
2289,angela,i dont talk about what goes on in the restroom
2290,dwight,im not asking what you do in there i just want to know whats written about michael
2291,angela,i dont says those kinds of things out loud its inappropriate
2292,dwight,okay ill talk you nod if i get it right does it have to do with his butt or his wiener
2293,kevin,i think his characters are pretty funny especially ping
2294,michael,well what should i do guys seriously do you want me to just cancel the dundies
2295,kelly,no we were just hoping you wouldnt do those characters like last time
2296,michael,ping everybody loves ping hes my most popular character
2297,oscar,i think many people find that character slightly racist
2298,michael,really well he is based on the chinese delivery guy that i have who talks exactly like that so i think you should take it up with him instead of me
2299,oscar,look im just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits
2300,michael,sighs well neither of you are chinese so what why do you care

4876,michael,yeah that gould is a real interesting guy a gem i can see why he and jan are no longer together if my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship he was verbally abusive he was curt he was he had an inability to communicate shall i say he was emotionally unavailable i dont know how she dealt with that as long as she did
4877,michael,never

4937,dwight,so its true  you have access to our emails
4938,michael,you know what the problem is
4939,stanley,i think i do
4940,michael,the problem is that when people hear the term big brother they immediately think its scary or bad but i dont i think wow i love my big brother
4941,kevin,i gotta erase a lotta stuff  a lot of stuff
4942,dwight,oh hey just so ya know if you have a lot of sensitive emails they need to be deleted immediately
4943,angela,i know

4957,pam,one is tall and brunette and the other one is short and blonde and perky and kinda judgmental  who do you think he should choose
4958,dwight,does he have access to their medical records
4959,pam,ummmm
4960,dwight,i think one of the greatest things about modern america is the computerization of medical records  as a volunteer sheriff i can look up anyones psychiatric records or surgical histories  yeast infections  there are a huge number of yeast infections in this county  probably because we are down river from that old bread factory
4961,michael,meredith has an evite from jim  barbeque at jims tonight  tonight  wonder where my evitation is  click on guest list  angela stanley oscar meredith phyllis kevin creed  must be scrolls down list no

5428,ryan,and i have to give it to her i dont have a choice
5429,dwight,yes now you can steal the oven mitt the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift
5430,stanley,after ryan opens a new gift  a nameplate saying kelly that was meant for kelly

5447,meredith,ill take the oven mitt
5448,michael,sucker see i wanted somebody to take it boom reverse psychology
5449,michael,reverse psychology is an awesome tool i dont know if you guys know about it but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid works like a charm
5450,michael,opens present in addition to these paintball pellets your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute
5451,dwight,you and me michael yes
5452,michael,who wants to take paintball lessons how is that better than an ipod
5453,dwight,i never said it was better than an ipod
5454,dwight,michael keeps bragging about his ipod but you know what two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as i am is worth easily like  grand
5455,dwight,shooting paintball gun at target take that saddam
5456,michael,last gift kevin

5469,jim,got to be kidding me
5470,dwight,yankee swap is like machiavelli meets  christmas
5471,michael,after phyllis leaves suddenly what is she so upset about
5472,pam,maybe because you hated her present so much
5473,michael,come on i think that yankee swap was a big hit i think its a success and im the one who ended up with dwights stupid paintball pellets
5474,jim,yeah but michael the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people
5475,stanley,and you should have just bought a  gift like everyone else
5476,michael,well i didnt i got a big bonus because i fired devon and i used the money to buy something awesome sue me

5493,dwight,true but i get sinus infections and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems
5494,jim,okay
5495,dwight,and pouring it directly into your nose like so demonstrates
5496,jim,to think that my gift for pam will be used for that its a little too much to handle

7172,jan,great great and pam what about you what is your dream
7173,pam,well i always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs plant flowers on it stuff like that since i was a girl um more seriously though a husband that i love roy and i love to draw and i i did a little in college and id still love to do something where i could work with art or graphic design in some way
7174,phyllis,shes real good
7175,pam,thanks
7176,jan,you know the company is offering a design training program in new york
7177,pam,well i have a job right now so i cant really take time off
7178,jan,well its only on weekends and then a few weeks in new york but im sure that i could ask corporate to help you out
7179,pam,well its just that the weekends arent good because um
7180,jan,there are always a million reasons not to do something
7181,michael,lets start with the warehouse what bothers you as guys you know
7182,darryl,my priority is safety
7183,michael,ok
7184,darryl,so it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift playing with it like a toy it kind of gets under my skin
7185,michael,ok yeah yeah yeah shhh
7186,darryl,uh uh uh dont shush me
7187,michael,i that was just
7188,darryl,that bothers me too
7189,michael,i was breathing
7190,roy,pam shushes me it drives me crazy
7191,michael,i hate shushing you know thats the thing what the ok what is our beef as human men
7192,lonny,you know thats a good question hasselhoff what bugs us
7193,michael,ok alright good guys ragging on each other thats what guys do and we love it
7194,jan,all right lets talk about clothing
7195,phyllis,im excited about today whispers i love girl talk
7196,jan,dress for the job you want not the job you have all right you can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be
7197,angela,im not gaining anything from this seminar im a professional woman the head of accounting im in the healthiest relationship of my life i just think its insulting that jan thinks we need this and apparently judging from her outfit jan aspires to be a whore
7198,roy,i hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then theyre like when are we going to go on a datedate
7200,darryl,i hate that too
7201,kevin,that sucks so much
7203,dwight,yeah and then they make you drive them to church the next morning like gas aint free
7204,lonny,yeah on our salaries man what do they expect you know to take us out every weekend you know what i mean were not millionaires
7205,michael,i feel you
7206,darryl,no you dont you dont feel us how can you you know what
7207,dwight,not literally
7208,darryl,you say were the same but we get compensated very differently
7209,michael,yes
7210,darryl,we work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
7211,michael,ah you do so
7212,darryl,but we get paid a lot less
7213,dwight,word
7214,roy,like next to no benefits
7215,michael,i know god what is that
7216,roy,exactly
7217,michael,it blows it blows man gah
7218,darryl,you know this would not happen if we had a union
7219,roy,thats what im talking about
7220,michael,no whoa whoa yeah
7221,roy,absolutely
7222,darryl,thats what we need
7224,darryl,man see thats what ive been sayin man we need to do this finally
7225,michael,you know what is that necessary because you already sorta have a union of guys
7226,darryl,its more than necessary mike we need this roy you still have that card from the dockworkers union
7227,roy,in my truck
7228,michael,dockworkers
7229,darryl,man hook you up
7230,jan,generalized clapping
7232,michael,yeah you know what i think the problem is the chicks
7233,darryl,union union yeah
7234,michael,the problem is the chicks and you gotta blame them
7235,darryl,are you with us mike
7236,michael,yeahes
7237,darryl,welcome to the warehouse
7239,jan,another issue is inequality of pay between men and women im sure that all of you have felt that before
7240,michael,knocks this is important ladies take a breather jan i uh wanna can i help you um i wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union and they have some good points
7241,jan,what a union what
7242,michael,dont get hysterical
7243,jan,im not
7244,michael,part of my job is knowing how to talk to women
7245,michael,lets be rational here what are the pros what are the cons
7246,jan,the cons are that everyone will lose their job michael everyone office warehouse what do you think the pros are here
7247,michael,dont talk to me that way please just theyre going to want to hear this from you
7248,jan,you got yourself into this michael so you get yourself out
7249,michael,but were bonding down there
7250,jan,thats too bad
7251,michael,i mean i just dont want to have to tell them something theyre not going to want to hear
7252,jan,i dont want to
7253,michael,ok come on jan after all weve been through
7254,jan,michael michael michael
7255,michael,we have a history
7256,jan,michael
7257,michael,between us
7258,jan,dont say another word
7259,michael,i wont
7260,jan,get yourself down stairs
7261,michael,im just saying we have something ok whatever
7262,ryan,you know what we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line
7263,stanley,this here is a runouttheclock situation just like upstairs
7264,jan,sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office now i know this might sound silly but a  many women ask to go over it so fumble means
7265,phyllis,mistake
7266,meredith,slip
7267,jan,right par for the course is a golf term it means right on track below par means worse wait that should mean better that doesnt make sense
7268,kelly,what about second base like if michael said that he got to second base with you does that mean you like closed a deal
7269,jan,excuse me
7270,kelly,i mean thats a baseball term right
7271,jan,i dont know what michael was talking about i dont know
7272,kelly,in the background and you went to chilis and he got to second base with you
7273,jan,in the background kelly i dont know what michaels talking about
7274,kelly,in the background he told everybody so i just want to know is that a baseball term
7275,pam,hey
7276,jim,hey
7277,pam,hows it going down there
7278,jim,its a complete well actually its exactly what youd expect so how are the girls
7279,pam,good we watched a video about our changing bodies
7280,jim,did you really
7281,pam,no laughs
7282,jim,oh
7283,pam,almost
7284,jim,good
7285,pam,um but hey something kind of cool theres this internship in graphic design that jan was telling us about she made it sound like really great
7286,jim,nice well whats it all about
7287,pam,um
7288,jim,i think you should do it thats great
7289,pam,its really cool
7290,michael,cold front coming into the warehouse uh oh better put on your ski boots woohoohoowoo waaaah happy new year darryl heydarryl you ever done this
7291,angela,are you married
7292,jan,im divorced
7293,phyllis,that must have been hard
7294,jan,it was yes
7295,kelly,you were probably feeling really depressed and sad and thats why you did that thing with michael
7296,jan,i think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff
7297,phyllis,mmmm i think were all okay with the balance weve struck
7298,angela,at least you dont have kids you have no kids right thank god
7299,jan,okay lets take five i think we can all use five
7300,kelly,how can someone so beautiful be so sad
7301,michael,hi
7302,jan,did you take care of the situation
7303,michael,yuh yuh yes i i have essentially
7304,jan,excuse me
7305,michael,i have essentially yes ive taken some
7306,jan,excuse me ive been told theres been some interest in forming a union and that michael supported it obviously hes not a friend of yours because he didnt tell you the facts so let me if there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch i can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that snaps her fingers they unionized in pittsfield and we all know what happened in pittsfield it will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs so i would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message if you have any further questions you can direct them to to michael
7307,pam,dreams are just that theyre dreams they help get you through the day like the thing about the terrace its nice but um i dont know it was just something i read in this book when i was twelve the girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and i just loved that just always kind of stuck with me
7308,jim,so youre not doing it
7309,pam,how did you know
7310,jim,why not
7311,pam,just like no big reason just a bunch of little reasons
7312,jim,come on
7313,pam,roys right theres no guarantee its going to lead to anything anyway
7314,jim,roy said that
7315,pam,what you have something you want to say
7316,jim,you got to take a chance on something sometime pam i mean do you want to be a receptionist here always
7317,pam,oh excuse me im fine with my choices
7318,jim,you are
7319,pam,yeah
7320,pam,its impractical im not going to try to get a house like that um they dont even make houses like that in scranton so im never going to
7321,michael,im just going to put this over there
7322,darryl,this is not a good idea right here
7323,michael,you did uh okay
7324,michael,pizza great equalizer rich people love pizza  poor people love pizza  white people love pizza  black people love pizza  do black people like pizza

7681,dwight,i cant do this

8596,oscar,is that true toby
8597,toby,oh when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing
8598,michael,two nights ago i went to an alicia keys concert at the montage mountain performing arts center i scored these great aisle seats anyway after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and i never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one i dont know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes and im sure that it was clove cigarettes everybody in the aisle was doing it
8599,michael,okay attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled  instead i will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection
8600,dwight,no you cant do that
8601,michael,i can do that it is my office

8615,kelly,so i was looking so hot
8616,michael,it has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about
8617,phyllis,we dont feel that way
8618,angela,no not at all
8619,oscar,you were the one joking around calling dwight a narc
8620,michael,no uh no that was a test  i was testing you and you all failed miserably when i said that dwight was a narc how many of you defended him  how many of you said hey you know what hes right what hes doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs
8621,dwight,thank you michael
8622,michael,i am ridiculously antidrug so antidrug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion or testing of any kind
8623,michael,drugs ruin lives people drugs destroy careers take cheech and chong everybody knows that cheech and chong are funny but just imagine how funny they would be if they didnt smoke pot  i want everybody to take a look to their left now i want everybody to take a look to their right one of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives this year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children
8624,stanley,where did you get these facts
8625,michael,are these facts scaring you or are they not
8626,stanley,they are not
8627,michael,do you think that smoking drugs is cool do you think that doing alcohol is cool

8852,angela,can we just skip to whatever number  is  winwin or whatever
8853,michael,winwin is number four and number five is winwinwin the important difference here is with winwinwin we all win me too i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work
8854,michael,in front of poster okay since this is the disputed poster now one at a time i want you to express your feelings using i emotion language and no judging or you statements
8855,angela,i got this poster for christmas and i feel i want to see it everyday it makes me feel like the babies are the true artists and god has a really cute sense of humor
8856,michael,come on seriously that
8857,oscar,i dont like looking at it its creepy and in bad taste and its just offensive to me it makes me think of the horrible frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it its kitsch its the opposite of art it destroys art it destroys souls this is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno im talking about the
8858,michael,okay okay stop stop stop lets see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are winwin
8859,pam,win
8860,michael,yes thank you pam how about angela makes the poster into a tshirt which oscar wears that way he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar she can see it winwinwin
8861,oscar,no
8862,angela,thats no
8863,michael,okay well brainstorm own the solution
8864,angela,how about i leave it up
8865,oscar,how bout she takes it down
8866,pam,how about angela can keep it up on tuesdays and thursdays
8867,michael,okay that is called a compromise and it is style  and it is not ideal to sum up winwin  make the poster into a tshirt winlose  take the poster down compromise  tuesdays and thursdays and the answer is make the poster into a tshirt winwin
8868,pam,win
8869,oscar,fine
8870,angela,but it

8897,toby,actually i have a separate folder for complaints against michael this unlocks a draweris january through march of this year pulls out a fairly large folder
8898,michael,how many of you have at one time gone to toby to complain about another employee looks at all the employees most of whom raise their hands and did you get what you wanted or were you merely listened to you forget about your problem and you move on employees mumble merely listen to and forgotten  that is outrageous i love this place and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering sighs okay today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open where it can be resolved alright how about the phyllisangela dispute
8899,angela,you already did me
8900,michael,thats what she said jim mouths these words along with michael the thing is angela you are in here an awful lot you have complained about everybody in the office except dwight which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with dwight toby by the way what does redacted mean there is a file full of complaints in here marked redacted
8901,toby,yeah it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it so i took their name off
8902,michael,oh ok there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago
8903,dwight,whoa wha wait if someone has a problem with me why would they withdraw it six months ago
8904,pam,notices angelas intense concern um lets move on i volunteer did anyone have a problem with me

9002,michael,reading every time i typed my name it said diapers
9003,jim,just a simple macro you know these actually dont sound that funny one after another but he does deserve it though

9081,dwight,im the one who petitioned the office board to have these id badges taken
9083,dwight,let me see your id
9084,michael,there is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby and they cant decide so they bring the baby to a wise man just like a manager in those days and the wise man says i will adopt this baby and raise it as a hindu see they didnt expect that and that fixed it because i think he was the dad anyway
9085,michael,there are dozens of old complaints in here cold cases like the show imitating gonging and toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murdersuicides are not important enough to solve well you know what i have a problem with that and im going to open up these cases before toby can kill or rape another person
9087,pam,thats not bad hey do you do weddings

9144,oscar,again we do that every year
9145,michael,well they need our money they dont have cookies like the girl scouts
9146,oscar,itd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering
9147,michael,well oscar if you dont like it then you should concentrate on winning because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive  to donate to the charity of their choice and they will get a minifridge compliments of vance refrigeration
9148,dwight,yes
9149,michael,so get your charities in to pam i for example am playing for comic relief

9156,kevin,something with animals or people
9157,kelly,kobe bryant has a foundation and he is so hot and he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring i know he didnt do it maybe he did it
9158,angela,we are giving money that has been gambled why dont we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves  and donate that money to charity
9159,michael,oh and another fun thing we at the end of the night are going to give the check to an actual group of boy scouts right toby were gonna
9160,toby,actually i didnt think it was appropriate to invite children since its you know theres gambling and alcohol and its in our dangerous warehouse and its a school night and you know hooters is catering you know is that enough should i keep going
9161,michael,why are you the way that you are honestly every time i try to do something fun or exciting you make it not that way i hate so much about the things that you choose to be okay you know what i will not donate my winnings to comic relief since apparently it doesnt exist i am going to donate to afghanistanis with aids

9500,dwight,my charity is the farm defense fund its one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm
9501,jim,my charity is the lackawanna county volunteer sheriffs department because dwights a volunteer sheriff so i thought this was a perfect opportunity to supportmock him
9502,dwight,i dont believe that jim moved that coat rack but if he did he has an obligation to use his gift wisely with great power comes great responsibility they could do a crosssection of his brain to find out more but i dont think its true though
9503,michael,look if anything goes missing we will reimburse
9504,darryl,yeah can dunder mifflin afford that
9505,michael,dang paper making paper ie money
9506,darryl,what

9509,michael,hey okay you know what dont even think i command you to just go down and have fun tonight all right dont think about it
9510,michael,our numbers are down yes but we have a heck of a crew here in scranton hardworking motivated dynamic every single last one of them they follow my lead i sort of set the tone and it doesnt hurt that my ex works for corporate jan loves this branch and i think thats really more than half the battle
9511,pam,it is extremely stressful planning a wedding by yourself its like a job i mean its fun but it kind of becomes like work ive already planned it all out in my head but its just in my head
9512,meredith,hey meredith right
9513,meredith,oh god oh no i have this problem all the time i never remember people ive had sex with
9514,meredith,im your vet

9524,michael,no  that is the fun of this place  i call everybody faggie why would anybody find that offensive
9525,toby,ok i think oscar would just like if you used lame or something like that
9526,michael,thats what faggie means
9527,toby,no not really
9528,toby,apparently you called oscar faggie for liking the movie shakespeare in love more than an action movie
9529,michael,it wasnt just an action movie it was die hard
9530,toby,all right michael but oscars really gay
9531,michael,exactly
9532,toby,i mean for real
9533,michael,yeah i know
9534,toby,no i mean hes attracted to other men
9535,michael,ok a little too far crossed the line
9536,toby,ok i am telling you oscar is an actual homosexual  yeah he told me this morning  and obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion
9537,michael,i would have never called him that if i knew  you dont you dont call retarded people retards  its bad taste  you call your friends retards when theyre acting retarded  and i consider oscar a friend
9538,michael,listen man i am so sorry  i had no idea
9539,oscar,no its fine
9540,michael,no  no its not  i feel terrible about it  i have been calling people faggie since i was in junior high and i have never made this mistake  if i dont know how to behave it is because i am just so far the opposite way you know  im just i i cant even imagine the thing  maybe we could go out for a beer sometime  and you could tell me how you do that to another dude
9541,oscar,that sounds like a great wonderful idea lets do that
9542,angela,in reference to oscar being gay it explains so much
9543,oscar,no im not gay  and i dont understand why anyone would think that im gay if sighs uh yeah im gay
9544,jim,i cant say whether dunder mifflin paper is less flammable sir but i can assure that it is certainly not more flammable
9545,jim,why did i transfer to stamford  i think thats pretty obvious  i got promoted  and you cant beat that view right
9546,andy,hey big tuna  youre single right
9547,jim,uhhuh yeah  i am
9548,andy,shes pretty hot huh jim nods  shes completely crazy  steer clear big tuna  head for open waters
9549,jim,ooook
9550,andy,ooook
9551,jim,i ate a tuna sandwich on my first day  so andy started calling me big tuna  i dont think any of them actually know my real name
9552,andy,big tuna is a super ambitious guy you know  cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy but i mean im not threatened by him  i went to cornell you ever heard of it laughs  i graduated in four years  i never studied once  i was drunk the whole time and i sang in the acappella group here comes treble
9553,josh,so end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher because of some more problems at the scranton branch  and i have a list of business startups i got from the chamber  yes i am going to need someone to cold call them
9554,jim,oh i can do that
9555,karen,jims nice enough  i dont i dont know how well hes fitting in here hes always looking at the camera like this  makes classic jimcamera face what is that
9556,michael,can you tell whos gay and whos not
9557,dwight,of course
9558,michael,what about oscar
9559,dwight,absolutely not
9560,michael,well he is
9561,dwight,well hes not dressed in womens clothes so
9562,michael,deep sigh there could be others  i need to know  i dont want to offend anybody else
9563,dwight,you could assume everyone is and not say anything offensive
9564,michael,yeah im sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay
9565,michael,hey what about angela   shes hard and severe  she could be a gay woman
9566,dwight,i really dont think so
9567,michael,i dont know i can imagine her with another woman cant you
9568,dwight,creepy smile
9569,michael,do some research  find out if theres a way to tell by just looking at them
9570,dwight,jim told me you could buy gaydar online
9571,michael,thats ridiculous
9572,dwight,yeah probably  he didnt tell the truth a lot
9573,michael,sighs lets call him and get the website
9574,dwight,definitely
9575,jim,whats gaydar  oh oh gaydar yes  no uh i think they have it at sharper image  oh you know what  i could check for you  no problem  loudly fake typing  its sold out  yeah sorry about that thats a bummer
9576,michael,well theyre sold out
9577,dwight,damn  thinks  ill try brookstone
9578,jim,i miss that
9579,roy,chicken or fish
9580,pam,loud sigh chicken
9581,roy,so you havin a good day
9582,pam,excellent thanks
9583,roy,good glad  ok
9584,pam,yeah i didnt go through with the wedding  i got cold feet a few days before  and i cant really explain it  i just had to get out of that relationship  we still had to pay for all the food  so we froze it  but im im doing well  i have my own apartment  im taking art classes  and i have lunch for the next five weeks
9585,roy,after pam dumped me i um i kinda stopped taking care of myself there and uh i hit bottom when uh drunk driving arrest  ive been working out and um you know im not gonna take her for granted  i gotta win her back
9586,stanley,i got them a toaster  they called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me  i tried to return the toaster to the store and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster  so now my house has got two toasters
9587,kelly,that is so cool that youre gay  i totally underestimated you
9588,oscar,yes im super cool  i am an accountant at a failing paper supply company scranton  much like um sir ian mcclellan
9589,angela,sure sometimes i watch will and grace and i want to throw up  its terribly loud  i do like it sometimes when harry connick jr is on  hes so talented
9590,andy,ok  who put my calculator in jello  good one  but uh seriously guys who did this  seriously guys who did this  i need to know who put my calculator in jello or im gonna lose my frickin mind
9591,jan,you know its amazing to me that in this day and age you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation
9592,michael,i watch the l word  i watch queer as f so
9593,jan,thats not what its called
9594,toby,ok michael are you aware that you ousted oscar today
9595,michael,what  what does that even
9596,jan,coming out is a significant moment for a gay person and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it
9597,michael,well gay pride right gay pride parade  its not like gay shame festival
9598,toby,all right now oscars feeling discriminated against by his coworkers primarily angela and um thats your fault
9599,michael,i think angela might be gay  could oscar and angela be having a gay affair  maybe  is that what this is about
9600,jan,no
9601,michael,i dont kn
9602,jan,no its not possible
9603,michael,anythings possible
9604,jan,you know imagine you were gay
9605,michael,laughs well im not gay jan and you should know that better than anybody
9606,jan,michael your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now  do you understand
9607,michael,the company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to  years of being weirded out by gays
9608,oscar,am i the first gay man you ever knew
9609,michael,trick question  cause you cant always tell so how would i know  is that the right answer
9610,pam,michael dwights looking at gay pornography on his computer
9611,dwight,uh michael knows pam  he asked me to do this just for him  he has his own reasons
9612,michael,looking at gay porn nothing wrong with this stuff  at all  this is fine  you know what  gay porn straight porn its all goooooood  i dont particularly get into this  but uh you know what  i totally see the merit  and actually it is quite beautiful
9613,dwight,ah damn popups
9614,oscar,what are you doing
9615,angela,watching some of your friends
9616,michael,yelling all right everybody in the conference room  i dont care if you are gay or straight or a lesbian or overweight  just get in here  right now
9617,michael,did you know that gay used to mean happy  when i was growing up it meant lame  and now it means a man who makes love to other men
9618,michael,were all homos  homosapiens  gays arent necessarily who you think they are people  i mean anybody could be gay  businessmen  like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants  oscar why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here  however you want to do it  go ahead  stand up  im doing this for you
9619,oscar,yes im gay  and i didnt plan on sharing that part of my life with you today so whatever  can i sit down now
9620,creed,im not offended by homosexuality  in the sixties i made love to many many women often outdoors in the mud and the rain  and it was possible a man slipped in and there would be no way of knowing
9621,michael,who should be the judges and juries of our society
9622,angela,judges and juries
9623,michael,yes thats a good point  she has a good point  because gay marriage currently is not legal under us law  i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them  so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could  you know  sounds pretty good right
9624,kevin,that sounds great
9625,dwight,i think all the other office gays should identify themselves or i will do it for them
9626,oscar,no one else in this office is gay
9627,dwight,what about phyllis  she makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine
9628,phyllis,im getting married to bob vance
9629,michael,thats great  congratulations phyllis  that is great and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing  laughs see  everybody has a chance
9630,michael,but still phyllis in college  did you ever experiment with other women  a lot of women do
9631,phyllis,no you knew me in high school  course we all thought you were gay in high school
9632,michael,laughing right  serious and i take that as a compliment
9633,phyllis,well with your ties and your matching socks and
9634,michael,well i just like to look good ok so
9635,oscar,you sound pretty defensive michael
9636,michael,no i am just coming out myself  i am coming out hetero
9637,oscar,i think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here
9638,michael,no no no  the only signal that i am sending is  gay good
9639,michael,look if i was gay i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen  i would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just i would be waving that rainbow flag
9640,oscar,i dont think i can work here any longer  this has been the worst most backwards day of my life
9641,michael,you misunderstand ok  you know what ok  i uh im gonna put my money where my mouth is  you ready  i am going to embrace oscar  you might want to watch this angela because you cant catch anything  here we go  we are going to make a statement  you and i are going to make a statement together  oscar is my friend
9642,oscar,i would rather not
9643,michael,and i just dont care who sees it doesnt bother me
9644,oscar,no no  i dont want to touch you ever consider that  youre ignorant and insulting and small
9645,michael,all right um sorry
9646,oscar,michael im sorry  that was a good idea  come on come on oscar and michael hug
9647,michael,sobbing im sorry i called you faggie  youre not faggie  youre a a good guy
9648,dwight,michael appears to be gay too  and yet he is my friend  i guess i do have a gay friend
9649,michael,embracing oscaryou know what im going to raise the stakes  i want you to watch this  and i want you to burn this into your brains  because this is an image that i want you people to remember for a long time to come  whenever you come into the office i want you to think about this  awkwardly kissing oscar  i did it  see  im still here  were all still here everyone claps
9650,michael,dwight gets up to kiss oscar  oh come on  dwight  come on man
9651,michael,we are not in the playground anymore  there are new rules  we have to be mature  but we cant lose the spirit of child like wonder  what is love  anyway  maybe its supposed to break all the rules  like me and jan  or oscar and some guy  life is short  when two people find each other what should stand in their way
9652,michael,i am glad that today spurred social change  thats part of my job as regional manager  but you know what  even if it didnt at least we put this matter to bed  thats what she said  or he said
9653,michael,oh theres gill  oscars roommate  i wonder if he knows
9654,oscar,i was going to quit  but jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car  all i had to do was sign something saying i wont sue  gill and i are going to europe  kids sometimes it pays to be gay
9655,dwight,reading the note with the gaydar  hope this helps  jim  nice
9656,oscar,dwight is running the gaydar over oscars body  what are you doing
9657,dwight,shhh  dont be scared  gaydar beeps over oscars belt buckle dwight smiles it works  gaydar goes off next to dwights belt buckle  oh no

9662,jan,specifically michael
9663,michael,specifically jan i will make at least ten phone calls to clients
9664,michael,yes i have to begin every day by letting jan know what i intend to accomplish and then i have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what i did accomplish but its not mandatory its something that i wanted to do and so its voluntary really even though she makes me i think she just wants to hear my voice because were no longer lovers and shes just hurting but things are going well with carol ive seen her seven times in the last few months and im growing very fond of her kids tommy who i call tomas and the little girl
9665,jan,on speakerphone are you on the toilet michael

10371,creed,about what
10372,michael,the older you get the bigger the chance is youre gonna die  you knew that
10373,creed,ed was decapitated
10374,michael,what
10375,dwight,really
10376,creed,he was drunk as a skunk he was flying down route   he slides under an  wheeler  pop  it snaps right off
10377,michael,oh my god
10378,dwight,that is the way to go  instant death  very smart
10379,creed,you know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated
10380,dwight,youre thinking of a chicken
10381,creed,what did i say
10382,michael,that is just not the way a dunder mifflin manager should go im sorry  alone out of the blue and not even have his own head to comfort him
10383,michael,clears throat so im not exactly sure how to say this
10384,dwight,ed was decapitated
10385,michael,what are you doing
10386,dwight,you said you didnt know how to say it
10387,michael,i didnt he was driving on the road and he went under a truck  and thats when his head was separated from the rest of him  and i will let you know more as soon as i find out
10388,dwight,hey
10389,angela,hi
10390,dwight,if my head ever comes off i would like you to put it on ice
10391,angela,i do not wanna talk about this
10392,dwight,when i die i wanna be frozen and if they have to freeze me in pieces so be it  i will wake up stronger than ever because i will have used that time to figure out exactly why i died and what moves i could have used to defend myself better now that i know what hold he had me in
10393,michael,i dont understand we have a day honoring martin luther king but he didnt even work here
10394,jan,on speakerphone i understand how you feel michael  i really do  so would it be helpful to give everyone the day off
10395,michael,you really dont get it do you  you dont understand these people  that is the last thing that they would want is a day off
10396,jan,well what would you suggest
10397,michael,thoughtfully a statue
10398,jan,of ed
10399,michael,yeah
10400,jan,scoffs im not sure thats realistic
10401,michael,well i think it would be very realistic it would look just like him
10402,jan,no thats not
10403,michael,we could have his eyes light up we could have his arms move
10404,dwight,that is not a statue that is a robot
10405,michael,i think that is a great way to honor ed
10406,dwight,and how big do you want this robot
10407,michael,lifesize
10408,dwight,mm no  better make it twothirds  easier to stop if it turns on us
10409,jan,what the hell are you two talking about

10443,michael,there are five stages to grief which are glancing at computer screen denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance  and right now out there theyre all denying the fact that theyre sad  and thats   hard  and its making them all angry  and it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance  and if not acceptance then just depression  if i can get them depressed then ill have done my job
10444,michael,i am going to throw you this ball  when you catch the ball i want you to say the name of a person very important to you somebody really special who died and then i want you to say how they died and you may cry if you like that is encouraged  let me just start  let me show you how this works   i catch the ball  i lost ed truck  and it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears and at the same time somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone and im crying and nobody can hear me because i am terribly terribly terribly alone
10445,roy,excuse me im sorry to interrupt uh i need to see pam  there seems to be like something wrong with the radiator in her car
10446,michael,okay fine  hurry back
10447,roy,as they leave theres nothing wrong with your car  i just thought you might like a break from the grief counseling session

10465,pam,lets see  i had an aunt that i was really close to  she was this amazing female boxer  um anyway she was injured in a fight and she was paralyzed  so you can imagine how upset i was when i found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die
10466,michael,wow  if you wanna cry thats okay
10467,ryan,catching ball  thanks  um a few years ago my family was on a safari in africa and um my cousin mufasa was um he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and um we all took it really hard  all of us kind of in the audience of what happened

10524,dwight,yes please
10525,pam,maybe you could play a song on your recorder
10526,dwight,excellent
10527,pam,do you have it with you
10528,dwight,always runs off
10529,pam,did i wake up this morning thinking id be throwing together a bird funeral  you never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into
10530,karen,spotting herrs chips on her desk whered you find them
10531,jim,whered i find what
10532,jim,i called the manufacturer who referred me to distributor who referred me to the vending machine company who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door
10533,michael,glad you could all make it
10534,kelly,you told us we had to
10535,michael,dwight do you have the box
10536,pam,actually i have it
10537,michael,you made this  wow impressed thats thats very nice
10538,ryan,when i was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it  and i remember thinking im a little too old for this  and i was five
10539,pam,id also like to say a few words if thats okay
10540,michael,yes
10541,pam,what do we know about this bird  you might think not much  its just a bird  but we do know some things  we know it was a local bird  maybe its that same bird that surprised oscar that one morning with a special present from above
10542,kevin,oh i remember that  that was so funny
10543,pam,and we know how he died  flying into the glass doors  but you know what  i dont think he was being stupid  i think he just really really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song
10544,dwight,hes not a songbird
10545,michael,shhh
10546,pam,an impression then  lastly we cant help but notice that he was by himself when he died but of course we all know that doesnt mean he was alone  because im sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much  he will not be forgotten
10547,angela,quickly amen
10548,dwight,begins playing recorder
10549,pam,singing just smile for me and let the day begin  you are the sunshine that lights my heart within on the wings of love
10550,michael,society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong well thats baloney because grief isnt wrong there is such a thing as good grief just ask charlie brown
10551,dwight,lets get back to work
10553,jim,umm sure
10555,jim,chuckles hes so cute
10557,jim,thats okay hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby oh no its not im sorry is that your husband in the tub with him
10559,jim,sounds good
10560,jan,on the phone ed truck died over the weekend
10561,michael,oh wow he
10562,jan,yeah and i know i know he was your boss so i thought you should know
10563,michael,does his family know
10564,jan,yes they know michael
10565,michael,but im the first in the office
10566,jan,i guess yes i think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team in case they want to pay their respects
10567,michael,okay yes sure i will do that
10568,jan,good
10569,michael,cause im the first to to find out nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them well good how are you holding up want me to come over jan hangs up
10570,michael,ed truck died and it blows they say that with grief time makes it worse which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so ive had more time to be sad
10571,dwight,attention everyone as you know ed truck is dead if you have any contact information on rolodex files or in microsoft outlook remove it now also if you have any photographs pam will make her shredder available during lunch that is all
10572,dwight,remembering the dead doesnt help anybody the way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again in this case some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body im working on both
10573,michael,i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor we need to find out what is blocking you and that way well be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored may he rest in peace
10574,kevin,ces chuckles
10575,michael,what was that kevin
10576,kevin,nothing
10577,michael,no you said something didnt you
10578,kevin,may he rest in pieces chuckles you know because theres like two pieces of him
10579,michael,you think thats funny
10580,kevin,no chuckles
10581,michael,you are disgusting
10582,dwight,michael no need to call corporate we are supposed to use toby hes trained as a grief counselor
10583,michael,no that cant be right
10584,toby,well i am trained in grief counseling but ahh i dont think thats what they need right now
10585,michael,well then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world doesnt it
10586,roy,hey there
10587,pam,hi
10588,roy,so hows your day going
10589,pam,well i will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone ive never met
10590,roy,that sucks laughs you guys got it much harder up here
10591,pam,closer to the epicenter i guess
10592,roy,laughs cool all right
10593,toby,well as you know ed truck passed away so im here to talk about it if anyone would like to
10594,kevin,not really
10595,michael,youre ruining it already they should not be given the choice
10596,ryan,i did not know ed truck so i will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend i think ed would have wanted it that way
10597,toby,is anyone having any trouble eating
10598,kevin,no
10599,toby,concentrating is anyone having trouble getting their work done today
10600,stanley,im having trouble getting my work done today
10601,toby,well look sometimes things crop up later so uhh you should know im always available if anyone would like to talk
10602,michael,wow wow no no you are the most heartless soulless person ive ever met
10603,toby,michael im sorry
10604,michael,no no shh enough it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here dwight ryan i want you to take the table out were gonna go on a five minute break and when you come back were going to start with a clean slate and in the interim i would like you to forget everything that toby has said okay
10605,michael,i dont think im overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company and he is worthless you give people a chance to shine and they blow it just like you knew they would grief counseling is not about are you hungry would you like a sandwich these people are so far gone you have to stick a food tube down their throats
10606,michael,okay part of the problem was that toby talked at you now i am going to talk with you first off i want you to be comfortable because you really cant grieve if youre all tight and buttoned up so guys loosen your ties just take your jackets off if you want ladies let your hair down you know what even take your shoes off i wanna get personal and i want you all to really open up and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said
10607,angela,okay i dont think kevin should take his shoes off
10608,kevin,my feet do not smell angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition
10609,michael,i found an exercise in tobys binder that he managed to miss that involves screening the part of you that says i dont wanna do that i dont wanna talk about that that is too private heres how it works im going to throw you this ball
10610,toby,yeah the ballthrowing exercise is in the binder its in the section marked fun ways to make brainstorming sessions explode with excitement and creativity
10611,roy,hey my cousin billy they just had the twins
10612,pam,really
10613,roy,yeah

10616,pam,yeah id love to see them oh and tell them i say congratulations
10617,roy,sure
10618,pam,i should probably head back in
10619,roy,yeah
10620,pam,but umm thanks for the break
10621,roy,no problem
10622,michael,in his office playing with a dunder mifflin truck when it drops and the head of the truck comes off
10623,pam,michael once told me that home alone is the saddest movie ever when i asked him why he said because the whole family forgets the kid at home there is nothing funny about that

10969,michael,i love the people here and if there was one thing i di dont really care for is that they can be terribly terribly ignorant about other cultures and i dont want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend carol
10970,michael,diwali is a very important holiday for the hindus but frankly im a little appalled that none of you know very much about indian culture so without further ado kelly you are on
10971,kelly,um diwali is awesome and theres food and theres going to be dancing and oh i got the raddest outfit it has um
10972,michael,kelly

12405,meredith,yes
12406,angela,god help you
12407,karen,what

13204,andy,in order to take down dwight i have to chip away at his ally which in this case is michael heres the good news every success ive ever had at my job or with the ladyfolk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down
13205,andy,whats the deal with dwight doing your laundry
13206,michael,ugh that is a long story um couple of months ago dwight tried to go behind my back with jan and get my job and i am now having him do my laundry as punishment

13222,andy,i think you have assembled an amazing team at scranton its really a pleasure to be a part of it its like everyone has their own special skill you know just like the superfriends except for dwight who is more like a superdud i mean he would be a superfriend if there was a superfriend whose super power was always being late you know
13223,michael,hawkman
13224,andy,my plan is taking longer than i thought but i dont give up easily i have walked two marathons

13227,dwight,no thank you i never let anyone walk behind me seven out of ten attacks are from the rear
13228,jim,ok well that still leaves a  chance that i will attack you from the front
13229,dwight,uh yeah but it will be easier to stop i can always block the blow i can counter it with jim slaps dwight
13230,pam,angela you seem so happy i bet you wish you were like this all the time
13231,angela,this friend of mine  lets call her noelle  she missed this deadline turning something in to corporate in new york but then this gallant gentleman  well call him kurt  he drove all the way to new york and handed it in for her thats i dont know i guess he really just likes her a lot

13238,michael,you know what lets get right down to it dundermifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse but what we lack in flash we will make up for with hardwork and decency
13239,andy,ok this is the classic undersell because you should know we dont work out of a log cabin we trade on the new york stock exchange ever heard of it its in new york
13241,michael,i think what andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company we will give you the care and attention of a small company
13242,andy,oh man that is like poetry
13243,michael,no
13244,andy,i swear this guy could sell paper to a tree

14717,toby,which is where
14718,dwight,irrelevant  discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrators eyes nose and face area  rendering him utterly and completely disabled  then i contacted the authorities  the end

14764,michael,there were these huge bins of clothes and everybody was rifling through them like crazy and i grabbed one  and it fit  so i dont think that this is totally just a womans suit  at the very least its bisexual
14765,kevin,who makes it
14766,michael,uh reading the inside of his jacket missterious  and it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side thats the mystery
14767,phyllis,look its got shoulderpads and did you see that lining

14781,michael,um lets just do this in  minutes
14782,darryl,okay can you just stand right there  snaps camera phone picture i gotta send some emails
14783,michael,negotiations are all about controlling things  about being in the drivers seat  and make one tiny mistake youre dead  i made one tiny mistake  i wore womans clothes
14784,kevin,karen how do you feel that roy tried to kick your boyfriends ass over another woman
14785,karen,i feel great kevin  thank you
14786,stanley,you must have been scared out of your mind
14787,karen,well you know it happened so fast i didnt really have time to be scared
14788,angela,what happened exactly  i wasnt here so i havent really heard the whole story
14789,karen,um well jim and i were talking and roy walked in looking super angry
14790,angela,mmhmm
14791,karen,and hes a big dude you know  and all of a sudden jim pushed me out of the way and roy cocked his fist and then bam dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt
14792,angela,flustered goodness
14793,karen,when i heard jim and pam had kissed my reaction was to have lots of long talks with jim about our feelings  roy just attacked him  im not sure which one jim hated more
14794,michael,lets get down to business  why dont you tell me why you think you deserve a raise
14795,darryl,well its simple mike i mean we merged these two branches right  so now were shipping twice as many orders as we used to  with roy gone we got a smaller crew  and im pickin up all of his slack so i think i should be compensated fairly by gettin a raise
14796,michael,mumbles jibberish
14797,darryl,what  i cant hear you
14798,michael,mumbling softly that was a very good point
14799,darryl,i cant what mike  are you
14800,michael,mumbling softly you make a very compelling argument
14801,pam,sorry i almost got you killed
14802,jim,yeah that was nuts
14803,pam,he could have broken your nose or something  crazy  its just so stupid  i mean getting back with roy and everything  i mean what was i thinking right
14804,jim,no i mean you guys really seem to have a strong connection
14805,pam,not anymore  its um its completely over now
14806,jim,well see  im sure you guys will find you way back to one another someday
14807,pam,jim i am really sorry
14808,jim,oh yeah  dont worry about it
14809,michael,i am going to give you a piece of paper  i want you to write down how much you want and i want you to slide it back across the desk to me
14810,darryl,why cant i just tell you
14811,michael,because that is the way these things are done  in films darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to michael no slide slide it yes
14812,darryl,there you go
14813,michael,oh scoffs come on  be serious
14814,darryl,i am serious mike  thats a  raise  thats what i want
14815,michael,i i cant give you that i i dont make this much
14816,darryl,come on be for real mike
14817,michael,i dont  want me to prove it to you  there is a pay stub
14818,darryl,laughs are you serious  youre earning this
14819,michael,plus perks yes
14820,darryl,mike this is barely more than i make  you been here ten years dog laughs

14823,michael,no please please
14824,darryl,oh im sorry mike some of my folks got to hear about this one  texting on cell phone ah laughs
14825,michael,ok lets take  again
14826,michael,a bosss salary isnt just about money it is about perks  it for example every year i get a  gas card cant put a price tag on that
14827,jim,ok if you dont want a gift at least let me buy you a beer or lunch or something
14828,dwight,when han solo returns to the death star in the millennium falcon and shoots down the tie fighters and saves the rebel cause do you think he does so for a free beer
14829,jim,boy i
14830,dwight,no  and why are you so interested in buying me something jim whats your angle
14831,jim,its like when he annoys me and i want to screw with him to get him back he never sees it coming  but now i want to be nice to him and actually give him something and hes like an eel  i just cant grab onto him  its infuriating
14832,karen,maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks
14833,jim,well yes thats probably what it is  so what do i do
14834,karen,hmm  i dont know  maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip
14835,kevin,michael heres the uh  i owe you
14836,michael,oh thank you

14848,darryl,get your own raise  you gotta get out there and earn son
14849,michael,im not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now  that is ridiculous
14850,darryl,well when they merged the two branches together they put you in charge  okay and were shippin more now than we ever have
14851,michael,exhales thats true

15061,michael,toby now has the floor  and he is going to try not to screw this up like everything else in his life  let me rephrase that  i believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as darryl  here we go
15062,toby,ok um one thing that youre gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome  its recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour  for your circulation youre gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh and move around about ten minutes every hour
15063,michael,yes good  fine  like stretching and
15064,toby,um yeah  youre computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes so uh its also recommended that you step away for about about ten minutes every hour
15065,michael,wow that is that time really adds up  thats like a half an hour every hour
15066,darryl,take them at the same time
15067,michael,ok you know what  youre making it sound kind of lame so skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff  like sometimes computers can explode can they not
15068,toby,no no  um you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort in case it gets drafty

15693,angela,why am i getting all of the bad ones
15694,kelly,why cant you just say youre sorry and make them feel better

15823,michael,uhhuh prove it lets see your penis everyone is shocked exhalesi you know as that was coming out of my mouth i knew that it was wrong
15824,michael,in all the excitement i forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe women cant have fun if they dont feel safe for example jan and i have a safe word in case things go too far foliage and if one of us says that word the other one has to stop although last time she pretended she didnt hear me
15825,jan,on speakerphone michael

15835,dwight,employees of this office are very small and delicate deserve  protection from local pervs better  innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free

15843,michael,attention everybody dwight has something he would like to say
15844,dwight,due to a recent incident involving phyllis a man a map and his penis  i think you know what im referring to  michael has authorized me to form an emergency antiflashing task force
15845,jim,raises hand question wont that interfere with your other task forces
15846,dwight,answer no because this is being given priority one this is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot and i know i know what youre thinking pam nods wont that just shed more light on the penises but that is a risk we have to take pam you can draw kind of why dont you work with  phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that i can post around the community
15847,pam,phallus
15848,dwight,phyllis sorry ive got penises on the brain back to work everybody
15849,pam,i dont often miss roy but i can tell you one thing i wish someone had flashed me when i was with roy because that would have been the asskicking of the year small laugh especially if it had been jim he would not have wanted me to have seen jims whoo i am i am saying a lot of things
15850,phyllis,i didnt really get a good look
15851,pam,thats ok i dont feel like answering phones
15852,karen,hey did you guys see this memo that dwight sent out reads memo women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding  inch females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by dwight schrute this is ridiculous
15853,dwight,attention i am removing all bananas from the kitchen
15854,karen,dwight this memo that you distributed is insulting
15855,dwight,desperate times call for desperate measures
15856,pam,reads memo sleeves down to the wrists buttonedup collars and muted colors nobody dress like that camera pans over to angela
15857,michael,ok you know something dwight we are not the terrorists why dont you just take these women put em in a burlap sack and hit em with a stick because thats what youre doing i celebrate these women they deserve the right to dress as they please if pam wants to show more cleavage she should be able to i encourage that
15858,karen,look its really simple we just want you guys to treat us with respect
15859,michael,see thats what were talking about did you hear that dwight

15866,dwight,you know what why doesnt oscar run the meeting hes a homosexual
15867,jim,why dont you run the meeting you play with dolls
15868,dwight,those are collectible action figures and theyre worth more than your car
15869,michael,you know what i am the expert i will conduct it i know the crap out of women
15870,michael,i um would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter
15871,creed,are we still discussing this i say again what is the big deal
15872,michael,nobody likes to be flashed when meredith flashed me at that christmas party i nearly vomited
15873,meredith,i dont remember doing that
15874,angela,what a surprise
15875,michael,ok no catfights please lets  my point is my point is a penis when seen in the right context is the most wonderful sight for a woman but in the wrong context it is like a monster movie
15876,dwight,alien blagh
15877,michael,what are shut it shut up ok so what i want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about womens problems and issues and situations magazines and tv shows and movies portray women as skinny tall goddesses well look around are women like that no no they are not points to pam even the hot ones arent really that skinny so what does that say that says that you women are up against it and it is criminal society doesnt care society sucks i dont even consider myself a part of society fyi because i am so angry over all of this
15878,andy,if it were up to me you ladies would be the fashion models
15879,kevin,yes andy then the fashion models could come here and work with me
15880,karen,what youre saying is extremely misogynistic
15881,michael,yes thank you that was not necessary but i appreciated it and i proves my point women can do anything
15882,karen,im saying that youre being sexist
15883,michael,no im being misogynistic that is insane i am not being sexist
15884,karen,that  its the same thing
15885,phyllis,michael
15886,michael,yes
15887,phyllis,when i got my hair cut short you asked me if i was a lesbian
15888,michael,because wha that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut
15889,angela,and when we get mad you always ask us if were on our periods
15890,michael,i have to know whether youre serious or not
15891,dwight,i wish i could menstruate
15892,dwight,if i could menstruate i wouldnt have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore id just be able to count down from my previous cycle plus id be more in tune with the moon and the tides
15893,karen,can we just get back to work
15894,michael,ye  ok yes
15895,angela,this is not work talk
15896,michael,youre right youre right youre right and you know why its because of where we are this is a masculine environment we need to find a place where you feel comfortable you know where were gonna go the steamtown mall kelly gasps
15897,karen,frankly its kind of insulting but i have a bunch of stuff i need to return in my car so i could do that
15898,angela,malls are just awful and humiliating theyre just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a juniors section there are petite adults who are sort of smaller who need to wear maybe a kids size 
15899,michael,ok lets go ladies of dundermifflin hey we should have a calendar printed up pam put that in my good idea folder pam nods lets go

16350,michael,being the boss is also about image  ive never looked like that that was gross i just i dont see the connection between a firewalk and management worst seventyfive bucks i ever spent you know what if i had to pick my replacement based on today it would be mr outside hire
16351,angela,or mrs outside hire
16352,michael,yeah  ummm hmm true  look i dont want to leave this branch that i love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round to test the aspect of my job that i think is the most important something i call the bob hope factor

16356,michael,whos amanda bynes
16357,kelly,shes from what a girl wants
16358,michael,oh i love that movie yes kelly is right the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope  so without further ado jim and dwight show us what you got
16359,jim,hey i know what youre looking for but um i got to be honest i really dont think i should be considered as your replacement

17179,pam,thats cool
17180,toby,yeah
17181,michael,perfect so our tragedy is your good luck satan
17182,angela,sprinkles never hurt a soul god in your infinite wisdom how could you do this she wasnt ready she had so much left to accomplish
17183,dwight,shes only a cat
17184,angela,you never you dont like them
17185,dwight,cats do not provide milk or wool or meat
17186,oscar,dwight please

17191,michael,alright i would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs
17192,toby,oh michael you cant ask about religious beliefs
17193,michael,satan is a master of lies everything he says is the opposite
17194,toby,alright well then you can ask about religious beliefs
17195,michael,thank you for the permission psych alright lets just go around the room and tell me what you believe in
17196,stanley,im um catholic
17197,michael,ok
17198,darryl,presbyterian

17205,angela,thats why were cursed
17206,creed,ive been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower you have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader
17207,michael,kelly you are hindu so you believe in buddha
17208,kelly,thats buddhist
17209,michael,are you sure
17210,kelly,no
17211,michael,what are you
17213,michael,ok  sikh and
17214,dwight,as a farmer i know that when an animal is sick sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery with the electricity were using to keep meredith alive we could power a small fan for  days you tell me whats unethical
17215,dwight,blink once if you want me to pull the plug
17216,meredith,dont pull any plugs
17218,meredith,better
17220,dwight,are you a doctor or a male nurse
17222,dwight,pfft her chart doesnt indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did or at least she got time off for one
17224,meredith,yes dwight here trapped it in a bag against my head
17225,dwight,just doing my job
17227,meredith,and a rat separate occasions
17228,michael,you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you and then you run over one person with your car sighs and its not even one of the popular ones and everybody gets on your case doesnt make any sense god is dead
17229,kelly,if there was a god then ryan and i would be married by now
17230,michael,maybe believing in god was the mistake what did people believe in before the sun maybe theres some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice too like a giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer with ah the body of a porcupine
17231,jim,i will do some research
17232,pam,i can help you with that
17233,dwight,so just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine
17234,michael,oh god rabies
17235,dwight,mmhmm
17236,michael,i was in the hospital room with her how contagious is that is that like an std
17237,dwight,no no youve gotta be bitten by something
17238,michael,this place is so cursed
17239,dwight,actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in lock jaw
17240,michael,walks out into the office i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering merediths life by hitting her with my car but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it
17241,jim,six of one really
17242,michael,turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies which is like  times worse than a little crack in your pelvis thanks to me she went to the hospital and i saved her life curse is broken curse is broken people kevin claps oh there is a god and he has a plan for us after all so go home get some rest very very good work today we got a lot accomplished
17243,michael,is there a god if not what are all the churches for and who is jesus dad
17244,kevin,pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying oh well if they arent together now then they probably never will be i thought theyd be good together like pbj pam beasley and jim what a waste what  a  waste
17245,pam,pams car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road i told you im not dating anyone and even if i was i dont think its anyones business i mean when i do fall in love like when its for real the last person im gonna talk about it too is a camera crew or my coworkers jim gets into the passenger side almost marrying roy anderson was as close to pamela anderson as i ever want to be jim leans over and kisses pam trust me when i fall in love youll know
17246,pam,michael scotts dundermifflin scranton meredith palmer memorial celebrity rabies awareness fun run race for the cure this is pam
17247,michael,proam
17248,pam,proam race for the they hung up
17249,michael,a woman shouldnt have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies but that is where we are in america and that does not sit right with me and that is why im hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies a disease that has largely been eradicated in the us but not very many people know that
17250,stanley,on the phone no rabies babies would be a good idea can i put you down for a dime

17268,kevin,no
17269,michael,ok well back in olden times a large fat person like this was a person of power a person who had money could buy food person of respect like the regional manager of the day whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was someone who worked in the fields and i was a peasant
17270,kevin,i just dont want to run i didnt bring my sneakers or my clothes
17271,michael,well youre going to have to run or youre going to be in a lot of trouble it is not olden times anymore

17768,jan,i hope hes gets hit with an ageism suit
17769,michael,what is that word
17770,jan,ageism companies they cant discriminate against people due to old age like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then ed truck your old boss threatened us with a lawsuit so we had to back off
17771,michael,so older people have just as many rights as younger people

17788,toby,technically hes right
17789,michael,hey shut up toby look why do we as a society hate old people so much
17790,creed,because theyre lame
17791,michael,no creed no they are not in fact many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability like the old lady from titanic points to her picture on the wall or the funny things that they can do like wheres the beef points to another picture on wall jim raises his hand yeah

18101,michael,everyone always wants new things everybody likes new inventions new technology people will never be replaced by machines in the end life and business are about human connections and computers are about trying to murder you in a lake and to me the choice is easy

18124,ryan,i spent three years driving around getting him yams and magic wands  he can get me water
18125,michael,i think i know whats going on  ryan believes that there is some sort of special boss water that he gets to drink now  and there isnt  but um dont tell him  dont tell him that  i dont want to jeopardize our friendship
18126,michael,ryan is causing some problems  and you were always good at handling him  what should i do to control him
18127,kelly,well hes superticklish i dont know if that helps
18128,michael,i know i know no what something else
18129,kelly,oh hes also superinsecure about his height
18130,michael,uhhuh
18131,kelly,and he doesnt care about anybody but himself
18132,michael,good
18133,kelly,and dont have sex with him cause if you do the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time
18134,michael,my generations all about hard work and accomplishment  like the moon landing  or vietnam  rolling stones  greatest band ever
18135,oscar,youre fortythree  mick jaggers like sixtyfive
18136,michael,and still rockin oscar  one of the greatest alltime oldies was a little oriental guy named confucius  he literally invented the ancient chinese secret  heres some of his quotes  confucius say man who farts in church must sit in his own pew  confucius say man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day  confucius also say virgin like balloon  one prick all gone
18137,oscar,did you google confucius and just print out the first thing you saw
18138,michael,no i skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page  which proves that he was old but he was also hilarious
18139,jan,sighs whistles michael please would you not email while were having lunch
18140,michael,im not  its solitaire  see
18141,michael,blackberry  why would anyone name something like this after a fruit  you wouldnt name an ipod after a fruit  drops blackberry on desk  excuse me while i type on my banana  im gonna go to the orange store and buy an apricot computer  thinks apple nods
18142,michael,this is going on the outside  the pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner  do not tape those on
18143,pam,hey michael
18144,michael,mmhmm
18145,pam,jan called and asked where youre going to meet for dinner  she wants you to call her
18146,michael,im a little busy right now  could you blackberry me a message
18147,pam,sure
18148,pam,michael doesnt know how to work his blackberry  so when he says blackberry me a message he means write it on a postit note and stick it to his blackberry
18149,ryan,okay everyone i have a conference call but after that im going to lead a blackberry tutorial for anyone whos having any problems  who heres set theirs up jim and andy raise their hands phyllis halfraises hers  ryan notices that michael does not raise his  great  well i will see the rest of you at 
18150,jim,you didnt set up your blackberry dwight
18151,dwight,yes i did but i do not intend to use it  it is pointless technology
18152,jim,as opposed to
18153,dwight,printing press  tractor  mechanical thresher  telephone  airplane  the only inventions that matter
18154,jim,what about cars
18155,dwight,they fall under the category of airplanes
18156,jim,they do  so cars are flightless airplanes
18157,dwight,correct
18158,jim,got it  theyre like the penguins of the airplane family
18159,dwight,thats an excellent analogy
18160,jim,thanks
18161,pam,hey dwight what about vaccines
18162,dwight,scoffs vaccines are for chumps
18163,dwight,my mom didnt believe in vaccines  i got my smallpox the oldfashioned way  and i survived  so jokes on you hospitals
18164,michael,creed is using the toaster as a mirror and touching up his hair with a sharpie and a comb the one advantage to being older is that i know a few things about a few things and i am young enough to not forget them  and old enough to know the difference between the two  i am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws but young enough to date college girls  but old enough to know better  im at a perfect age  i could die now  but i wont because i am young
18165,creed,sup rolls into kitchen on a skateboard
18166,kevin,hi creed whats up

18173,creed,suit yourself  but if it were me botox points at oscar wig points at kevin
18174,kevin,wha
18175,michael,and the same thing goes for quarterly reports  they are unreadable  theyre just numbers and boring and blech  so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic like if we have a bad quarter put in a storm cloud and when we have a good quarter fireworks or a racecar everyone groans doesnt have to be a racecar  use your imagination
18176,jim,theres this cube on the screen and it bounces around all day and sometimes it looks like its heading right into the corner of the screen and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away  and we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner  pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room okay  i believe she thinks she saw it
18177,pam,i saw it  i saw it and it was amazing  who said i didnt see it  did jim say that i didnt see it i saw it
18178,michael,we have a lot of colored paper here why oh why do we keep printing this on white screen saver box hits the wall
18179,andy,dah  come on
18180,michael,yeah  i know  i know  its bland
18181,oscar,its never gonna happen
18182,kevin,dude you gotta believe
18183,michael,maybe we could have some sort of riddle
18184,jim,to pam wait for it
18185,michael,like something that you have to look for  sort of a wheres waldo screensaver box hits the corner of the screen
18186,everyone,oh yes

18492,all,disagreeing with michael
18493,michael,you know what  i dont understand when you all talk at the same time

18495,oscar,michael theres a very big difference between these two pizza places  both in quality of ingredients and overall taste  which one did you order from
18496,michael,pizza by alfredo
18497,all,shouts of disapproval
18498,michael,okay okay whats better  a medium amount of good pizza  or all you can eat of pretty good pizza
18499,all,medium amount of good pizza
18500,michael,sighs walks back into office
18501,kevin,oh no its bad  its real bad  its like eating a hot circle of garbage
18502,phyllis,you can pick one of these things  its unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this
18503,angela,it should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do
18504,phyllis,balls up postits and throws them in angelas face
18505,angela,ow
18506,phyllis,that seemed to shut her up
18507,andy,are you looking for dinner and a movie  because youre not going to find it in that box  camera pans to kevin giving an are you kidding me look
18508,andy,just so happens that i know where you can find it but again not in the box

18525,oscar,its not pizza
18526,michael,okay it doesnt say it anywhere on the coupon and if its policy it should say it on the coupon

18734,pam,interrupting the city mirrors or the
18735,michael,the big free mirrors that the city puts up on trees and telephone poles  the big round things
18736,pam,the ones for drivers to check their blind spots

19590,michael,hey everybody i just got off the phone with david wallace and he has given us the goahead to make the first ever dunder mifflin television commercial  huh
19591,everyone,applause
19592,michael,i cant hear you less applause  heard you a little bit less that time  must be
19593,dwight,we had already applauded
19594,michael,okay okay  who could do music
19595,pam,how about darryl
19596,michael,actually im a little concerned about having a black person do the music because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a celestine prophesy and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano
19597,jim,michael is on a mission to prove that hes creative  which i think is odd because michael actually might be the most creative person ive ever known  every day michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before
19599,karen,yeah
19601,karen,thanks ro  hey we finally connected  hows scranton
19602,karen,i am the regional manager of dundermifflin utica branch  turns out its a pretty easy gig when your boss isnt an idiot and your boyfriends not in love with somebody else
19603,karen,look all im saying is it would be a great opportunity and wed love to have you come aboard  so think about it okay  okay bye
19604,karen,look for the record a certain scranton salesman approached me okay
19605,michael,this is perfect
19606,dwight,he looks like your twin
19607,michael,this is a dummy a la ferris buellers day off  we have tied a string to the wrist which goes to the door  when somebody opens the door the hand goes down hits the remote turns on the tape recorder which is me snoring  now nobody knows whether i am here or whether i am gone
19608,dwight,i will know

19615,michael,what

19619,jim,oh i dont think that is whats happening
19620,michael,okay smarty pants then why  why is she trying to take stanley from us
19621,stanley,i think its because of my sales record
19622,michael,that could not possibly be it
19623,michael,you cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office  stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary  the bluesy wisdom the sassy remarks the crossword puzzles the smile those big watery red eyes  i dont know how george bush did it when colin powell left and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley they have another thing coming
19624,michael,how can i get you to stay

19953,michael,a bunch of guys in a tent making smores makes a noise and gestures with his hands
19954,jim,whats that
19955,michael,hello im broken mountain you know heres the thing thats not how you go camping i think you go camping by yourself

19960,jim,i thought we had that looked at
19961,michael,im sick of it jim im sick of this place
19962,michael,when jan and i had satellite we used to watch a reality show called survivorman and it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die try not to get eaten by an animal or be overexposed
19963,michael,ok i will only need two things roll of duct tape and a knife
19964,dwight,winks im on it leaves room

19967,michael,hey hey hey dwight dwight rolls out an assortment knives dwight
19968,dwight,i keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office i saved jims life with a can of pepper spray i had velcroed under my desk people say oh its dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place well i say its better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally than by a stranger on purpose
19969,michael,dwight and i are going out he will return later but i will not i will also be taking a personal day tomorrow and perhaps the next day

19980,jim,yup
19981,michael,when i return i hope to be a completely changed human being
19982,jim,thatd be great
19983,dwight,do i believe that michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment lets put it this way no i do not
19984,michael,this is what a true survivor man does you simulate a disaster like a plane wreck you could only wear the clothes that you have on and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets now in this case this disaster is a serial killer creepy guy whos abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead
19985,dwight,no i would never leave you for dead you would never escape
19986,michael,well yes i would and i would survive
19987,dwight,i would make sure that you were dead
19988,michael,well
19989,dwight,first i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified
19990,michael,you
19991,dwight,and they would call me the overkill killer
19992,michael,you you are as creepy as a real serial killer for real blindfolds eyes with tie ok
19993,dwight,what are you doing
19994,michael,i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings now this way i cant retrace my steps i dont know what streets weve been dwight whacks michael with his shoe ow what are you doing
19995,dwight,it would be better if you were unconscious
19996,michael,no gosh dwight dwight tries to hit michael with his shoe again stop it stop it stop it
19997,dwight,do you want to do this right or not
19998,michael,just please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life

20004,jim,you know what i have an idea why dont we just do one big shared party
20005,angela,what
20006,jim,there are thirteen people working in this office so thirteen times a year michael gets a cake and balloons and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast there are two types of toasts one is a joke about how old you are
20007,michael,flashback to stanleys birthday look at those wrinkles blacks do crack not crack the drug
20008,jim,and the other is something inappropriate or horrible or both what else he only sings the high harmony to happy birthday and hes a very big believer in surprise parties maybe even arguably possibly to a fault
20009,michael,flashback to kellys birthday hiding in the elevator happy birthday
20010,kelly,ahhh drops the papers she was holding
20011,michael,flashback to oscars birthday hiding in the break room happy birthday

20813,jan,yeah
20814,michael,and the neighbors blamed jan
20815,jan,yeah  but you know it was my fault
20816,michael,its like you know the dog shouldnt have been outside in the first place  anyway its a tragedy really because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds

20838,michael,pam when i first opened this catalog i thought i was just going to be picking out a chair
20839,pam,but instead you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair
20840,pam,michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago and normally i wouldnt care but he promised me his old one its way better its one of these makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as pam slumps down i really want it

20847,michael,oh yeah maybe but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women
20848,pam,i definitely remember your dinner party
20849,michael,i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman whispers jan i think that fate put this catalog in my hands
20850,pam,actually i put the catalog in your hands cause you have to pick out a new chair
20851,michael,what is it like being single i like it i like starting each day with a sense of possibility and im optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results

21704,jim,okay you know what why dont you take my hand and leave them and lets get out of here
21705,pam,okay okay
21706,kevin,chuckling its michael versus stanley and it is the clash of the titans in one corner you have michael and he is mad and then in the other corner you have stanley and hes mad so thats about it
21707,michael,starts to cry i dont understand why you keep picking on me
21708,stanley,oh for the love of god
21709,michael,you just do and i dont know why so please help me understand
21710,stanley,fine here it is you are a person i do not respect the things you say your actions your methods and style everything you would do i would do it the opposite way
21711,michael,well stanley maybe youre feeling that you dont respect me because you dont know me very well
21712,stanley,michael i have known you a very long time and the more ive gotten to know you the less ive come to respect you any other theories
21713,michael,all right you dont respect me i accept that but listen to me you cant talk to me that way in this office you just cant i am your boss cant allow it
21714,stanley,fair enough
21715,michael,i am good person and sometimes good people dont get no respect rodney dangerfield as rodney dangerfield hey i dont get no respect no respect at all when i was in the sandbox as a kid i got not respect my wife likes to talk after sex so she called me from a hotel room and said i dont respect you ahh thoughtless aw you know what dont get no respect airplane food why dont they just make the plane out of the airline food my wife dont get no respect sometake her please for example as jeff foxworthy if you dont get no respect you might be redneck as borat respect is niiice borat as rodney dangerfield whats the deal with grapenuts no grapes no nuts i dont get no respect
21716,michael,so im thinking as a reward for our loyal clients that we contact their assistants and we find out where they live and then we go to their houses in the middle of the summer and go caroling it is a summer christmas saleabration and we call it a summer salesalot feedback anybody stanley
21717,stanley,has potential to be your best idea yet michael smiles
21718,phyllis,thats the dumbest thing i ever heard laughs
21719,michael,dammit phyllis alright everybody out except phyllis
21720,michael,you know i dont care what he did to me  hes mean to other people thats what gets me  hes just
21721,jim,who else is he mean to
21722,michael,everybody  he just hes always hes always talking about people behind their backs to me
21723,pam,what kind of stuff does stanley say
21724,michael,like that people are stupid and that theyre idiots and that theyre sluts
21725,kelly,why would he say that
21726,michael,because hes mean  hes hes like a really meanspirited guy  he talks about how gay oscar is
21727,jim,mmhmm

21731,jim,shes never worn these glasses before
21732,michael,well hes just mean
21733,pam,michael i think that what stanley did to you was rude  maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly
21734,michael,its complicated pam  i mean the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk
21735,jim,well i actually agree with her i think you should talk to him  and you also might want to explain to andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash
21736,kelly,oh yeah and then yell at creed because you know what  looking can be as bad as touching
21737,michael,okay
21738,michael,i put stanley on a pedestal for a long time  but sometimes he can just be a big fat jerk  i jerks dont deserve to be on pedestals  jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are  big marble jerk stand
21739,michael,pam stand up
21740,pam,hi everyone  my name is pam and i wear glasses

21771,toby,i know um but ryan thinks that uh theyre not good enough
21772,ryan,wallace likes jim  so going after him  thats a risky move for me but in business you gotta take risks  sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway with the top down pushes button about eight times to get the top down  finally it comes down and its all bunched up  as hes fixing it the car rolls backwards a bit

23242,michael,woo  alright
23243,michael,why are you helping her  youre not even dating  shes my friend and ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship without her even knowing uh
23244,michael,ok lets give it for miss holly flaaaax everyone claps
23245,holly,thanks michael michael groans exhaustingly today were going to have a business ethics seminar because recently without mentioning any names there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired
23246,kevin,oh come on  hes right there points at ryan he was hired  to jim oh check it out hired guy
23247,jim,nice they bump fists
23248,ryan,ok elephant in the room  lets talk about it  do i regret what i did  of course i do  even though it was an amazing ride and ill give you an example  anyone see survivor season six dwight raises his hand anyone know joanna on that show dwight nods in new york city i hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that  indistinguishable so
23249,michael,clapping ok  well done  good speech ryan youre a good guy
23250,holly,lets start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning  it is wrong to make personal calls during work hours now some of you marked that you very strongly agree  but ideally you would have selected totally agree
23251,phyllis,i thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree
23252,holly,corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement
23253,michael,well i think we can all totally agree that holly is totally fantastic claps
23254,holly,thank you  in fact spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing
23255,kelly,what
23256,holly,yes its called time theft and its the same as taking money from the company  can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters
23257,stanley,this meeting
23258,andy,heyoh
23259,dwight,yes
23260,michael,to holly cant set em up like that
23261,kelly,why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time  if i want to go outside and hang out once an hour then ill just take up smoking  ill do it  i dont care
23262,meredith,ill smoke with you  i got a bag of cigars in my purse
23263,holly,stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about
23264,michael,can we have a moment  whispering can i talk to you for a sec  lot of good stuff and you look you look fantastic
23265,dwight,michael
23266,michael,yeah
23267,dwight,what should we be working on while you guys are talking
23268,michael,do some do some work whispering to holly people expect a lot from these meetings  laughter sudden twists  surprise endings  you need to be robin williams and m night shyamalan  you need to be robin shyamalan
23269,holly,well i just have to get through the binder
23270,michael,do you just youre kind of losing them
23271,holly,i am
23272,michael,yeah dont think about the stakes  itll freak you out
23273,holly,ok to everyone michael makes a really good point so uh lets just open this up a little bit say my name is lauren and here i am shopping in a supermarket and i steal a pencil  thats not right
23274,michael,coughs to hide his words lauren coughs enough with the pencils
23275,holly,no i have to go over pencils and office supplies  its part of the ethics thing
23276,oscar,that isnt ethics  ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good  this is just the corporate antishoplifting rules
23277,andy,ill drop an ethics bomb on you  would you steal bread to feed your family  boom
23278,oscar,exactly andy
23279,andy,yeah i took intro to philosophy twice  no big deal
23280,dwight,its a trick question  the bread is poisoned  also its not your real family  youve been cuckolded by a stronger smarter male
23281,andy,no thats not how it works
23282,michael,i would not steal the bread  and i would not let my family go hungry
23283,holly,ok but we should get back to business  have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace
23284,michael,anybody  this is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions  stanley  oscar come on
23285,oscar,pass
23286,michael,i will go first  when i discovered youtube i didnt work for five days  i did nothing  i viewed cookie monster sings chocolate rain about a thousand times
23287,holly,what was the dilemma
23288,michael,to tell you or not  and im glad i did  i feel very very good  cathartic  i promise you that you are not going to get into trouble  you can say anything you want with total and complete immunity
23289,holly,oh no no no
23290,michael,yeah interrupting gibberish  come on anybody  let it fly
23291,oscar,ok once in a while ill take a long lunch
23292,michael,a siesta
23293,dwight,time thief  time thief  fire him
23294,jim,dwight youve really never stolen any company time
23295,dwight,never
23296,michael,you are a thief of joy  anybody else  yeah
23297,kelly,sometimes i download pirated music onto my work computer
23298,michael,who hasnt  good  good  what else
23299,holly,no i id like to hear more about that
23300,michael,mmm
23301,angela,i once reported oscar to the ins  turns out hes clean but im glad i did it
23302,michael,well lets keep this party movin on
23303,meredith,ill go  have you guys ever met bruce meyers the scranton rep for hammermill
23304,michael,bruuuuuuuuuce
23305,meredith,well for the past six years i have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and outback steakhouse gift certificates
23306,jim,jackpot
23307,michael,ach wuh
23308,holly,meredith that is serious  i mean not only that a conflict of interests theres also an exchange of goods
23309,meredith,exchange of steak  have you ever had sirloin steak honey
23310,michael,thats crazy  thats crazy talk  meredith  the merenator sleepin with suppliers  hooooh  wow  what time we got checks watch you know what  thats a good place to end it  right there  this i think was a great ethics seminar  she has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about  right what is wrong  whos to say  really  in the end  i mean because it is unknowable  but lets give her a round of applause  holly everybody  holly  get back to work everyone applauds then leaves to holly great job  i am truly impressed  that uh you really pulled that one out  classic  classic meeting  we should celebrate
23311,holly,michael there is some serious issues with meredith
23312,michael,oh
23313,holly,i mean all of you have done things i wouldnt have done myself but merediths actions are really over the line
23314,michael,nnyeah  what ya gonna do
23315,holly,so regarding this supplier approximately how many liaisons have there been
23316,meredith,liaisons you mean meetups  i dont know once a month for six years  something like that
23317,michael,meredith why dont you tell holly its not what she thinks  nothing unethical happened and that you just like to sleep around
23318,meredith,am i in trouble here or something
23319,michael,no no this is just a stupid formality
23320,holly,no its not a formality  now were these um meetups just personal  unrelated to business
23321,meredith,nah i wouldnt have done it if it wasnt for the discount paper  theres not a lot of fruit in those looms
23322,michael,ughh  for the love of god were trying to help you stupid bag
23323,holly,what i dont understand is why the steak coupons  i mean if you were already getting the discounted paper
23324,meredith,well its funny  maybe its a girl thing but after we did it and he would give me those coupons i just felt good about myself holly begins to write in her notebook hey whats going on here  i thought i had immunity
23325,holly,well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace  i mean ive never heard of anyone whos kept their job after something like this
23326,meredith,well im not quitting
23327,jim,starts a stopwatch as dwight yawns stops it when dwight is done yawn  four seconds
23328,dwight,what are you doing
23329,jim,oh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so im just making sure
23330,dwight,oh so wait a minute youre going to time me every time i yawn  thats absurd jim smiles and starts the stopwatch really in a mocking voice oh hey look monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody  hes ti dwight conceeds and goes back to work jim stops the watch
23331,jim,personal conversation  seventeen seconds
23332,dwight,there is no way that that was jim starts the watch
23333,jim,stops the watch one second
23334,michael,well well  holly lujah  its a miracle youre at your desk
23335,holly,its mikeraculous
23336,michael,hooooh  reaching  youll get there  anyway i was giving it some thought and theres no reason that two attractive good looking intelligent funny attractive people cant you know just sit down and work this whole meredith thing out
23337,holly,sounds good
23338,michael,good  would you care to bang it out over lunch
23339,holly,oh i already bought this
23340,michael,oh no no no  your food is no good here my lady  sweeps her food into the trash can misses  sorry  you know what  lets go out  dunder mifflins treat  um actually youre not a client so well just split it  ethical
23341,holly,so ive gone over corporate policy
23342,michael,what do you think  what do you think of this place
23343,holly,oh its very nice
23344,michael,istnt it  yeah its kind of businessromantic  so youre from des moines
23345,holly,mmm
23346,michael,wow that sounds so warm
23347,holly,in summer
23348,michael,here too  you know what my favorite season is
23349,holly,maybe we should talk about meredith first
23350,michael,yeah get the boring stuff out of the way  autumn was what i was going to say  when the leaves change  its just i i think it is the most contemplative of seasons
23351,holly,ok so i have gone over this and i have thought about it and i just dont think there is any way i can write a report that doesnt end with her being terminated
23352,michael,wow terminator terminator
23353,holly,im from da future
23354,michael,yeah
23355,jim,hey andy
23356,andy,yo
23357,jim,by any chance did you see battlestar galactica last night
23358,andy,no i did not  was that any good
23359,jim,actually not  it was really soso
23360,dwight,ok dwight turns around but jim holds up the stopwatch threatening to start it
23361,jim,i mean i like all the crazy monsters and stuff  you know like klingons and wookies and all that but dwight begins to turn around again jim holds up the watch sorry was there something you wanted to add dwight
23362,andy,is that anything like the original battlestar galactica
23363,jim,you know its weird  its practically a shot for shot remake
23364,andy,really dwight closes his eyes clutches the paper in his hands huh thats cool
23365,jim,storys kinda bland  its about this guy named dumbledore calrissian who needs to return the ring back to mordor
23366,andy,really  that doesnt sound right
23367,michael,i just dont want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance  i mean what sort of place is that to call home  and meredith needs this job  this is her main source of money
23368,holly,well thats very sweet but we have to follow the protocol  those are the rules
23369,michael,ok new idea  we dont report it at all  we just punish her
23370,holly,we punish her
23371,michael,mmhmm tell her she cant have sex for six months
23372,holly,i dont think we could enforce that
23373,michael,i dont know  i saw this thing like a belt with a key
23374,holly,a chastity belt
23375,michael,no its more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of sometimes they are made of metal  you know what i am talking about  you unlock a little door that down where you where you put where you put the
23376,jim,he has not stopped working for a second  at  he sneezed while keeping his eyes open which i always thought was impossible  at  he peed and i know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports  and on the flip side i have been so busy watching him that i havent even started work  its exhausting being this vigilant  ill probably have to go home early today
23377,michael,i am just saying that i dont think that you understand what i am saying
23378,holly,no you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet accept the discount on supplies not fire meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened
23379,michael,yes
23380,holly,what am i saying
23381,michael,well bleh busted  i dont
23382,holly,im saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and i dont think i want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated
23383,michael,well you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family
23384,holly,its not a family  its a workplace
23385,michael,i will be honest with you  that car ride did not go well and that was not my fault  the only reason i am standing out here right now is because i dont want to take the elevator with her  and i am holding on to her leftovers throws hollys leftovers in the trash
23386,jim,dwight walks back to his desk  minutes and  seconds  what were we doing for  minutes and  seconds
23387,dwight,none of your business
23388,jim,so i guess i can assume that was personal
23389,dwight,dwight stares at angela buttoning the top button of her blouse fine
23390,jim,so maybe youre not completely ethical after all
23391,dwight,yes maybe im not dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera
23392,holly,its been a little tense  people are suspicious of me  and my best friend in the office wont even talk to me turns out being the morality police does not make you popular  i should know because in middle school i was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker  i was just hoping middle school was over
23393,ryan,kendall from corporate hr is on line one and holly is on her way in too
23394,michael,whats the only thing worse than one hr rep
23395,ryan,two hr reps
23396,michael,you get me
23397,holly,can i sit
23398,michael,i dont know  can you  kendall my main man
23400,holly,yes that came out during the ethics seminar
23401,michael,let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar
23403,holly,oh i think it is pretty clear that it was unethical
23405,holly,umm kendall i understand that the discount is good for the company but im just not happy about the way we are getting it
23407,holly,no i understand
23409,holly,no  i can do it
23411,michael,how do you tell somebody that you care about deeply i told you so  gently with a rose  in a funny way like its a hilarious joke  or do you just let it go because saying it would just make things worse  probably the funny way
23412,holly,can i have everyones attention  excuse me may i have everyones attention please  we need to finish the ethics seminar
23413,andy,no way lady
23414,kevin,its a trap
23415,holly,everyone please i just need your signatures to show corporate that i gave you the training

23422,holly,in this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days  sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers  personal days on the other hand are much more flexible

23431,holly,stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about
23432,oscar,thats a big ethical area
23433,oscar,listen i would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics  why isnt the company doing better  mmm it could be the pad of postits i took home last week  or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the ceo for a year of substandard performance  im sure well cover both in the seminar
23434,creed,ive done some things im not proud of  committed some atrocities in vietnam uh two years ago  princess cruise lines
23435,phyllis,during our honeymoon safari in africa bob and i were driving late at night and hed been drinking and suddenly thump  we hit something with our jeep  it was probably a man  we didnt know what to do  we heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us so we just kept driving as fast as we could  we bribed the airline got on a plane that night and fled home  maybe it was just an ostrich  in a soccer uniform

23581,holly,ahoy
23582,michael,ahoy so how you doin
23583,holly,good
23584,michael,um listen  jan levinson is coming in today and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy  the child of which i have a vested interest  its all kind of weird  anyway she is incredibly fat and enormous right now  extremely unattractive  and you are on the other hand one of the more attractive people in the office  so while shes here i am going to be acting kind of cold to you  and i am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings  and im treating ryan the same way
23585,holly,of course yeah
23586,stanley,i do not like pregnant women in my workspace  theyre always complaining  i have varicose veins too  i have swollen ankles im constantly hungry  do you think my nipples dont get sore too  do you think i dont need to know the fastest way to the hospital
23587,jim,jan enters the office pushing a stroller jan
23588,jan,hi jim
23589,jim,what do we have here
23590,jan,this is my baby
23591,jim,really
23592,dwight,oh no michael enters and notices jans baby
23593,dwight,jan had the baby and michael wasnt there to mark it  so the baby could be anybodys  except michaels
23594,michael,so this is astird
23595,jan,astrid
23596,michael,oh ok  why didnt you call me
23597,jan,well um you know labor just kind of started very suddenly and
23598,michael,i could have helped
23599,jan,and the birth instructor thought it wasnt a good idea for you to be there so
23600,michael,oh man him that guy he had no sense of humor and i proved him wrong in so many ways
23601,jan,ok you dont have any idea what ive been through so lets
23602,michael,no i dont
23603,jan,im sorry i thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet
23604,michael,can i hold her
23605,jan,yes yes you can you know i think just leave her in the car seat yeah
23606,michael,cradling the car seat awkwardly all right ok
23607,michael,i love babies i think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways  i try to pick up and hold a baby every day if possible because it nourishes me  it feeds my soul  babies are drawn to me and i think its because they see me as one of them  but cooler and with my life put together a little bit  if a baby were president there would be no taxes there would be no war  there would be no government and things could get terrible  it actually probably  it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion
23608,michael,carrying the car seat ladies and gentlemen it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office assst
23609,jan,trid
23610,michael,trid levinson  hi  astrid this is everybody look  this is your family  youre going to know them for the rest of your life

25844,michael,all right attention everyone
25845,jim,let me call you right back okay
25846,michael,i have made my decision we do not need a new copier we do not need new chairs this copier is puts paper on glass and makes a copy then takes paper from glass working perfectly
25847,oscar,thats the original
25848,michael,pam would you stand up for a sec sits in pams chair hmm see how relaxed i am i like this chair slowly sinking into the chair offers good support it is urkelnomically correct its a good chair i think were spoiled because we dont appreciate the things that we have you think kids in africa have chairs no they sit in big piles of garbage you think they have copiers  the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where michael is not visible over the desk they dont have copiers they dont even struggles to get up from pams chair gah they dont even have paper and we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it my point i this i have seen the light in terms of what we need and it is nothing
25849,oscar,do you know
25850,michael,do i know what

25971,michael,an intervention  its sort of hard to describe but really its its a coming together its a surprise party for people who are who have addictions  and you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves  and then they stop

26024,dwight,i stab her in the brain with a wooden stick
26025,dwight,there are several ways to kill a zombie but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick
26026,michael,everyone in this room loves you but mark my words we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore  the next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out
26027,dwight,oh as fire marshal i would have to

26297,michael,right what
26298,david,utica albany all the other branches are struggling but your branch is reporting strong numbers michael smiles look youre not our most traditional guy but clearly something you are doing is right and i just i need to get a sense of what that is
26299,michael,david here it is my philosophy is basically this and this is something that i live by and i always have and i always will dont ever for any reason do anything to anyone for any reason ever no matter what no matter where or who or who you are with or or where you are going or or where youve been ever for any reason whatsoever
26300,michael,sometimes ill start a sentence and i dont even know where its going i just hope i find it along the way like an improv conversation an improversation
26301,michael,this is going to sound sort of highmaintenance but could we have it like three degrees cooler in here i always think better when its cooler
26302,david,heres the thing michael is doing something right and in this economic climate no method of success can be ignored its not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now its hail mary time
26303,michael,pokes his head in hey what say we order up some pasta
26304,david,what say we do

26471,jim,thank you accounting department
26472,kevin,so what do we do now
26473,dwight,riding in car with michael what if the owner of prince family paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets
26474,michael,i will seduce her
26475,dwight,no i wanna seduce her
26476,michael,no i will seduce her
26477,dwight,please michael please
26478,michael,no i got it
26479,dwight,youll fall in love with her
26480,michael,yeah so what if i did that would take precedence and i would expect your support
26481,dwight,okay lets go over the plan again
26482,michael,alright i am a local business owner dwight nods along i need to buy paper  i find out everything about their prices and policies
26483,dwight,your fictitious name
26484,michael,michael scarn
26485,dwight,i am a paper salesman looking for a new job i find out everything about their expenses and salaries
26486,michael,okay
26487,dwight,then we meet at the dennys
26488,michael,interrupting no
26489,dwight,and then we compare notes
26490,michael,no no i never said dennys ihop
26491,dwight,no arguing over each other
26492,dwight,you know how i feel about ihop
26493,michael,oh dont start
26494,dwight,are you socialist
26495,michael,you know what i dont want to get into this debate again i enjoy ihop
26496,dwight,ill have a cup of a coffee
26497,michael,you will have pancakes and youll like it
26498,dwight,store only has three employees
26499,michael,so what
26500,dwight,it means they are not expanding
26501,michael,maybe they are shrinking
26502,dwight,no
26503,michael,they could be shrinking
26504,dwight,no because their sign is centered perfectly above their store no sign of the sign being moved
26505,michael,ah ha popping something in his mouth yup
26506,dwight,spying through binoculars its lunch time and no sign of anyone coming in or out which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch
26507,michael,mm hmm
26508,dwight,which means theyre not acquiring new business so once again no growth
26509,michael,and there are clouds there are clouds in the sky which means gonna rain bad for business
26510,dwight,oh it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus
26511,michael,argh why are you all
26512,dwight,get your clouds right
26513,michael,shut up
26514,dwight,so you go in now i am going to go in exactly ten minutes we have never met each other we are complete strangers also we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger lick ur lips try it michael licks lips no no like this dwight starts and michael follows passionately licking their lips good
26515,michael,ready to do this
26516,dwight,yeah
26517,michael,good here come the sharks they imitate jaws theme sounds and dwight makes shark fin on his forehead
26518,michael,in nature there is something called a food chain its where the shark eats a little shark and the little shark eats a littler shark and so on and so on until you get down to the single cell shark so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business
26519,michael,hello
26521,michael,my name is michael scarn i am a local business owner and i would like to find out about your company
26523,michael,thank you
26525,michael,we are a law firm
26527,michael,you know i will be honest with you about something where we used to live our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and i just didnt feel like a priority so i guess my question reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it for you would be reading off sheet how many clients do you have
26529,michael,really that many this doesnt seem like a very big operation
26531,michael,ah so when did you set up shop
26533,michael,oh vietnam i hear its lovely
26535,andy,each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments topic hillary swank is attractive
26537,kevin,the debate is whether she is hot
26538,stanley,what difference does it make attractive beautiful hot were talking about the same thing here
26539,kevin,huge difference a painting can be beautiful but i dont want to bang a painting
26540,andy,okay tmi
26541,michael,so even specialty paper say  brightness doublebonded you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock
26543,michael,well that is because i am a genius
26545,michael,yes well about some things and other things i am very stupid like watch this is this the cup picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion is this the cup picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion is this what i drink out of glug noise both laugh laughter is my job tears are my game law is my profession

26552,dwight,pshaw thats nothing ive  clients myself you had better look out someone might run you out of business
26554,dwight,me too smirking
26555,jim,i think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures you know we dont really see them as real so therefore we dont judge them as real people
26556,kevin,are you serious jim just show us a picture
26557,oscar,kevin cmon
26558,kelly,yeah shut up kevin
26559,kevin,hes making all these fancy uh its a gut thing
26560,jim,kevin you know what why dont you close your eyes imagine that hilary swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you in a more and more seductive voice and says kevin malone i just read your online profile and there is nothing i would rather do then make out with you right now and now you tell me something is she hot kevin gets up to join the hot team to their great joy does that end the debate
26561,kevin,kevin sits down gets right back up and heads back to not hot team no its is she hot not would you do her respect the game

26812,michael,nobody should have to go to work thinking oh this is the place that i might die today  thats what a hospital is for an office is for not dying  an office is a place to live life to the fullest to the max to an office is a place where dreams come true
26813,michael,shhh dont excite him dont make him excitable whispering welcome back stanley

26830,dwight,this is a farce i should be teaching this course
26831,michael,shut it  shut it
26832,michael,we found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his when his heart went berserk and i knew exactly what to do but in a much more real sense i had no idea what to do  so i thought we should have cpr training class and of course you cant get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it red cross you know racket
26833,kevin,giving chest compressions to the practice dummy i cant keep doing this forever
26835,kevin,call it

26842,phyllis,he needs to rest
26843,michael,no rest for the sick we are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working  what are you gonna do if youre by yourself and your heart stops
26844,stanley,i would die
26845,michael,and youre okay with that
26846,stanley,im okay with the logic of it
26847,michael,uhuh  no no no  come on get up  lets do this

26997,dwight,speaking of which hands michael the paper to sign for dwights formal apology
26998,michael,remember when people used to say boss when they were describing something that was really cool like those shoulder pads are really boss man look at that perm that perm is so boss its what made me want to become a boss and i looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads but now boss is just slang for jerk in charge
26999,michael,ok everybody ive figured it out the reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think jim shakes his head at the camera you are keeping these feelings inside and that is whats causing stress so what is the solution solution is honesty laughter and comedy in short

28052,michael,im not taking im not taking
28053,dwight,wasnt my idea loved  but i cant
28054,michael,wait a second wait a second i wrote it down in my diary
28055,dwight,you dont keep a diary
28056,michael,yes i do youve just never seen it reading from diary march th dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets
28057,dwight,hold that thought dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns flipping through diary march th michael scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year
28058,michael,why do you have a diary
28059,dwight,to keep secrets from my computer
28060,michael,ok you know what you came up with this idea i remember you told me that you loved the willy wonka movie when you were growing up
28061,dwight,impossible
28062,michael,yes you did
28063,dwight,i wasnt given candy as a child so a movie that fetishized it that much would have made no sense to me plus we werent allowed to see movies so do the math
28064,michael,what are you writing dwight writes in diary
28065,dwight,had conversation with michael about taking credit for an idea that wasnt mine discussed movies
28066,michael,would you like to go to lunch with me just the two of us
28067,dwight,with all my heart
28068,kevin,you guys are throwing a lot at me
28069,jim,all im saying is that its a first dates so just keep a respectful distance
28070,kevin,right
28071,pam,i dont think jim means to say that you shouldnt touch her
28072,jim,no that is what i mean
28073,pam,to jim shush to kevin kevin a playful touch on the arm or on the back it can show your interest and its really romantic
28074,kevin,puts hand on jims hand like that
28075,jim,no stop it
28076,andy,dont touch her dont talk to her dont look at her
28077,andy,jim andy and pam all talking over each other turn into this black and carbon brickwhere this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that
28078,michael,we think a lot alike sometimes you will think something and i will say what youre thinking
28079,dwight,ok what am i thinking right now
28080,michael,umm nacho chips
28081,dwight,no how skin is the largest organ of the body
28082,michael,oh ok let me just cut to the chase dwight i want you to fall on your sword for me
28083,dwight,oh not gonna happen
28084,dwight,i did fall on my sword once i was running with it in my belt wont happen again
28085,michael,why do you even want to stay at dunder mifflin i mean whats the point youre cooped up in there all day you dont get to do your farming youre not dating angela anymore it doesnt matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea it doesnt matter me on the other hand i would be lost without this place you way too manly
28086,dwight,what about shoe la la
28087,michael,sighs its not ready yet
28088,michael,i have an idea for a fancy mens shoe store called shoe la la and its just mens shoes for the special occasions in a mans life like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby or for just lounging around the house
28089,michael,may i have your attention please i have an announcement mr dwight schrute and i just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although i probably will never do it again i had fun i really had fun with my best friend dwight

28092,dwight,i love working here and i do not want to leave
28093,michael,he doesnt love it that much wouldnt be such a bad thing for him to be fired
28094,dwight,well
28095,michael,i mean like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion
28096,dwight,we discussed the fact that im cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world
28097,michael,right
28098,dwight,no plowing my own acres going around shirtless all day you know experiencing freedom
28099,michael,thats it thats it you cant put a price on freedom
28100,dwight,try me
28101,michael,thats why you made the decision thats why you made
28102,dwight,i havent made a decision yet

28444,charles,number two
28445,jim,secondincommand to michael
28446,charles,oh i didnt know that position existed

28461,david,ok
28462,michael,cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party just pulled the rug out from under me and he said no figs ive already bought em and i dont have a place to store them so i feel like ive been sort of boned

28465,david,well i didnt know about the figs specifically
28466,michael,ok then i dont get it it doesnt make any sense to me because i thought in the new system i was supposed to talk to charles and then charles was supposed to talk to you and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again
28467,david,thats not exactly
28468,michael,clearly thats what you wanted

28470,michael,fifteen years i have been here and i have sacrificed a lot

28482,phyllis,its just me here
28483,kelly,i am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight
28484,phyllis,i think he left
28485,kelly,what move pushes cameraman out of the way
28486,angela,kelly runs to parking lot in the rain hello charles charles
28487,kelly,hey is that his scarf
28488,angela,no kelly chases angela through parking lot
28489,angela,out of breath and wet charles and kelly absolutely not he is a sophisticated man he does not need to go dumpsterdiving for companionship ok
28490,michael,i dont understand that after fifteen years of service here i have to get in the car and drive to new york in order to talk to you  that doesnt seem right to me that doesnt seem fair and i think that ive earned more than that

28504,michael,i had no idea when i got in that car and headed to new york i was going to quit  i got on that ramp and i thought two hours two hours to go  feeling good  listen to some tunes  shouldve peed before i left
28505,kelly,michael get to the good part
28506,michael,okay so  i get up to the building i get to the revolving door broken  so i have to take the normal door

29593,dwight,ha ha april th 
29595,michael,thats very rude
29596,dwight,i barge because i care april th  that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased
29598,dwight,la la la continuing  notice my persistence and recall continuing you called dunder mifflin and your order was filled within an hour
29599,michael,im going to pull a date out of the air right now april th  that is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs is it not we all know that the economy is bad and bloated companies like dunder mifflin
29600,dwight,come on
29601,michael,are going to fall by the wayside two of their branches have closed within the last year the michael scott paper company however has opened a new branch this very month

29610,dwight,how is tom the homosexual sophomore
29611,michael,i wanted to start a company not a war because in a war you always fight those you are closest to and the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother for what what purpose did that serve apart from abolishing slavery in that case war was the right choice this doesnt feel as important though thats just how the world works i guess
29612,michael,he gives me leads and i take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good and if a friend cant make you feel good then i dont want any friends except dwight because he is our only source of fertile leads
29613,michael,dwight just got howard family dry cleaners
29614,ryan,uncle dave
29615,michael,hes undercutting us big time hes actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket

29617,pam,when are you ever responsible for your actions
29618,ryan,get off my ass you hag

29620,michael,betrayal aint just a river in egypt
29621,andy,who is that knocking on my taste buds why its mr lemon hmmm nice to meet you
29622,pam,its good but wont it feel weird cutting into a cross
29623,andy,dont think of it as a cross in the judeochristian sense think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage
29624,jim,when i think of it like that i do not think of the other connotations
29625,andy,yes
29626,pam,i dont think so andy
29627,jim,sorry her day
29628,andy,hey bud

29669,michael,like in a dorm room  you put your desk underneath you have your loft up top  you can sleep up top
29670,pam,yeah i know what a loft is
29671,ryan,most dorm rooms dont even have that
29672,michael,most do in the magazines

30005,jim,stronglypainted picture
30006,dwight,no pictures are too interpretive
30007,jim,can i just say something  i know that tempers are high but i think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to michael directly

30254,michael,what about the rest of you complete silence
30255,michael,at dundermifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and i dont know who instituted it i think it started right after my predecessor stepped down but at the michael scott paper company i really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday so rules be damned i wanna have lunch with these people
30256,michael,who else who else ryan
30257,ryan,i dont do lunch im eating five small meals a day now
30258,ryan,now that im back to doing the job of a temp again i find that food is one thing i can control
30259,michael,ok anyone anyone at all accounting i am accounting on you to go to lunch with me
30260,angela,no i dont want to stay late to have a two hour lunch

30273,dwight,attention office who here is planning a trip to youngstown ohio i will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something this location is the superior court
30274,pam,so someone is going to a court big deal
30275,dwight,it is a big deal cause theres only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in ohio and not be charged with a crime to claim an inheritance from a deceased relative to obtain a learners permit at age  and a half instead of  erin let me see your birth certificate
30276,erin,sure
30277,jim,there are other reasons to go to ohio
30278,pam,were getting married today

30280,pam,tell em how it happened
30281,jim,ok so were going through all the wedding plans and boy it is complicated
30282,pam,and very expensive

30989,oscar,stares at andy incredulously
30990,andy,would i push him away how hard like what if hes like really aggressive
30991,oscar,if you resisted brad pitt a little bit he would still need to get to you

31218,creed,think theyre talking about me
31219,michael,no i think theyre talking about me
31220,creed,yeah that makes way more sense   okay thanks boss
31221,michael,what is jim telling him  that i cant handle this job  that s bull crap  that is bull crap  although it has been chaotic lately  corporate shut down the buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients  i will tell you there has been work everyday  had to come in on a saturday to retrieve i left my cell phone here
31222,pam,hey kelly
31223,kelly,ugh so jealous of your boobs
31224,pam,thank you  um listen i just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to the wedding which is totally understandable and more than fine
31225,kelly,is ryan going
31226,pam,i dont know he hasnt rsvpd yet
31227,pam,we invited everyone in the office to our wedding  even though we realized most people wouldnt be able to make the drive to niagara falls  whispers which is why were having it in niagara falls  normal volume then michael told everyone they could have friday and monday  off if they came  so now people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work
31228,kelly,heres the deal  i really want to go but im not gonna go if ryan doesnt go because its kind of a waste of time  that came out wrong  it would awesome if you could try to get him to go because id really like to be there to support jim
31229,andy,what can i do for ya hoss
31230,michael,staring into the conference room how are your sales doin
31231,andy,how are my sales doin  busted  my numbers are down a little bit and its cause of the economy  youre not buying it youre good  okay the truth is i have been having trouble focusing lately  im in this weird flirty nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and its a total mind effer
31232,phyllis,again with the cousin
31233,andy,oh im sorry phyllis you explain this email okay   hey andy lets go visit grandma and then get drunk together ha ha
31234,michael,shhh im just trying to figure out whats going on in that room okay
31235,michael,wallace had to show up on the one four month period that im completely overwhelmed
31236,michael,you know when they say its so crazy it just might work  well i dont believe that  i say go for the airtight plan and that is why i am having andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart  it is just elegant
31237,michael,in the cheese cart be my eyes
31238,andy,you got it
31239,stanley,what have we here
31240,andy,oh just backing up and turning around
31241,kevin,hey were gonna do this
31242,andy,dit dit dit dit its not for you enters the conference room  pardon moi messieurs  i took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which i will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room
31243,david,cheese platter
31244,andy,oui oui monsieur  from the wisconsin region a nice firm cheddar  also from the great state of wisconsin an aged parmesan  here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which i think youll  find both challenging and delicious  at that point i would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of illinois where you will find this fine bleu cheese dressing  if i may be so bold its a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese  bon appetit
31245,david,alright well i should go  thanks for this  youve given me a lot to think about  please promise me you wont do anything until we speak
31246,jim,no i wont   alright thanks for giving me your time  i appreciate it

31285,david,are you sure youre okay with these new responsibilites
31286,michael,look who youre talking to
31287,david,im just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyones talents
31288,michael,well i would say that my greatest talent is being the best man woman or child to have ever run this branch ever
31289,david,what about jim  do you think jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position
31290,michael,looks at jim   permission to speak on the record
31291,david,please do
31292,michael,jim is like big bird  he is tall and yellow and very nice  but would i put him in charge  no i dont think so  because big bird doesnt make the tough decisions  i if i was gonna put someone in charge i would put burt in charge or i would put one of the real grownups in charge like maria or gordon maybe
31293,david,i thought you liked jim
31294,michael,very much jim is my best friend but its his performance report right here  now this was written by toby who we all know is extremely reliable
31296,michael,its not very well written but you get the gist
31297,david,is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch
31298,michael,i can just continue to run it myself
31299,david,jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then jim would be promoted to your position
31300,michael,this was jims idea
31301,david,mmhmm
31302,michael,wow  ummm well id have to talk to my mother and my guy at h and r block
31303,david,ummm okay heres the thing though  the plan doesnt work unless we have someone to replace you  i was hoping plus we have to worry about jim he has another job offer  we may have to replace him
31304,jim,i didnt tell michael because i thought hed try to help  example he handed out jello shots at the rd mile of the steamtown marathon
31305,david,jim can you walk me out to my car for a second
31306,jim,sure
31307,michael,after talking to david jim looks dejected i cant help but feel partially responsible
31308,michael,shakes jelly beans little pick me up  jim accepts oh those are the best  little sugar rush
31309,jim,when you were in the office earlier talking to wallace did i come up at all
31310,michael,well we did talk about how handsome you are
31311,jim,why dont we head in your office to talk
31312,michael,oh what a week god  we said i know there were certain things we said
31313,jim,michael look ill just be honest with you  earlier today i spoke with wallace about a promotion  i actually think that talk went really well  and then after he spoke with you for some reason it felt like things had changed
31314,michael,hmmm thats weird thats weird its kinda weirding me out  did you know that lincolns secretary was named kennedy
31315,jim,michael did you say anything
31316,michael,tell you what when you leave this office i am going to call wallace and i am going to tell him that you should get that promotion
31317,jim,really
31318,michael,yes
31319,jim,you will  wanna do it right now
31320,michael,yes
31321,jim,i tried to keep michael in the dark  i should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark
31322,dwight,i need to see your pupils   i need to see if theyre dilated
31323,toby,if they were dilated
31324,darryl,toby dwight  is that them
31326,darryl,you come to my house bust up my trash cans call my baby sister an ass and told her to eat dog food

31329,dwight,are you are you serious  be cause you look exactly alike  am i the only one  are you getting this
31330,toby,no nah  i dont see it

31342,michael,wha heres the thing jim is the best man for this job i think you should give it to him
31343,david,well it doesnt change what you showed me in jims file
31344,michael,well nnnn that that was an anomaly  that file had been falsified  toby flenderson is doing drugs

31351,darryl,stupidest thing ive ever heard
31352,dwight,really  then why is there new wood only on one railing  hmmm   we should check the security tapes toby
31353,toby,well i dont think theres any reason to check em but i suppose if we wanted to be really certain
31354,darryl,alright yeah fine so whatever
31355,dwight,yes
31356,toby,you really did it
31357,dwight,now i would like to file an official complaint to corporate because darryl lied on an official form
31358,darryl,and im telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister
31359,dwight,phhhht  no judge is gonna believe that
31360,toby,ahhh kay  look we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork but you know we can just move on with our with our lives
31361,toby,so dwight and darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now i get to do all this paperwork  we worked it out

31382,michael,i like that so manager and comanager
31383,david,comanager and comanager  see there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way i can sell it upstairs

31458,michael,mmhmm
31459,jim,and im wondering if perhaps those are a bit um
31460,michael,disruptive
31461,jim,yes
31462,michael,no i dont think they are i think the meetings are very important
31463,jim,okay maybe we should talk specifics
31464,michael,lets do
31465,jim,okay yesterday we had a meeting about planets
31466,michael,n well to be fair jim james jimothy to be fair jimothy the ah that sounds weird are you okay with being called jim
31467,jim,i am
31468,michael,alright jim to be fair the conversation wasnt about planets
31469,jim,right
31470,michael,at first we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon so you draw a line from there to the other planets and i think by the end we all learned a little bit about how small we are
31471,jim,yes i agree
31472,michael,because its a big universe and were all just little tiny specks of dust
31473,jim,i just think that maybe theyre eating large amounts of the day
31474,michael,you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps you go to sleep its light out you wake up its dark thats the whole day where did that day go i have no idea
31475,jim,you mean on a weekend
31476,michael,yes
31477,jim,how about this i think our goal should be we dont have meetings unless theyre absolutely essential
31478,michael,alright no more meetings this week
31479,jim,really you just agreed to that
31480,michael,i can be very suprising
31481,phyllis,whats going on
31482,pam,i need to fit into my wedding dress however im also pregnant
31483,ryan,you know its a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy look at these actresses some of them lose weight
31484,phyllis,hey did you guys register for wedding gifts
31485,pam,we did but mostly because people expect us to were also accepting other gifts not on the registry however much
31486,pam,its awkward asking people for money but we could really use it why doesnt crate  barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash
31487,phyllis,perfect i hate registries
31488,pam,oh good
31489,phyllis,my cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes i know i shouldnt tell you but youll still be suprised when you see it youre not registered for a birdhouse are you
31490,pam,no were not
31491,phyllis,good good
31492,michael,mmhmm
31493,jim,walks in sees oscar stanley creed and kelly sitting in michaels office okay i thought i saw people missing
31494,michael,yeah just focusgrouping a product expansion idea to these folks got one of each
31495,jim,really hey stanley what was the last thing michael said before i came through the door
31496,michael,stanley you dont need to answer that
31497,jim,stanley
31498,stanley,if you dont smell this youre fired
31499,jim,okay michael i thought we agreed to not take up peoples time with meetings like these
31500,michael,what do you mean by these people
31501,jim,michael this is a conference room meeting
31502,michael,oh hey everybody i think that jim has gone insane because he thinks that my office is a conference room
31503,jim,thats not what i meant
31504,michael,listen jim no offense but when push comes to shove what i want is more important that what you want
31505,jim,i disagree
31506,michael,what do you guys think all start talking at the same time
31507,jim,great guys can i just have a moment alone with michael
31508,michael,no no no you dont need to go anywhere anything that jim has to say to me he can say in front of these types of people
31509,jim,that is not what i said and also i am comanager meaning you are not the only manager anymore i am also i comanager
31510,michael,that is not what wallace told us
31511,jim,thats exactly what wallace told us
31512,michael,that is not the way i heard it
31513,kelly,i love rivalries michael or jim paris or nicole heidi or lc its so much fun but i guess if im really thinking about it and answering your question honestly id have to go with lc  heidis a bad friend and her skin is terrible
31514,michael,it is one thing me giving you the comanager title it is another thing you bossing me around
31515,jim,im not bossing you around im trying to do my job which is sharing your job so maybe we should just call david wallace
31516,michael,no no no no we will not call david wallace michael pulls out his cell phone i will call david wallace
31517,erin,david wallace is on line two for you guys
31518,michael,or david wallace will call us on line two why dont we just

31527,jim,david i know that im very new at this but i have a very good perspective on how things work

31538,jim,right
31539,michael,all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are
31540,jim,alright lets get started
31541,creed,hey why havent we ever um
31542,meredith,we have
31543,michael,you know theres no easy way to do this i say we add  to their paychecks and dont say anything about it
31544,jim,do you mean like breakin in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll
31545,michael,no we can do it during the day it doesnt have to be that dramatic jim
31546,jim,okay you know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options
31547,michael,jim dont take this the wrong way are you gonna take this the wrong way
31548,jim,its hard to tell so far
31549,michael,you use your brain too much
31550,jim,im sorry are you advocating that i use it less
31551,michael,sometimes the smartest people dont think at all
31552,jim,you just came up with that
31553,michael,as i was saying it
31554,jim,yeah okay so for the  increase pro everyone gets a little bit
31555,michael,in nerdy voice con you look like a nerd
31556,jim,con no one gets as much as they did last year
31557,michael,pro you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds
31558,jim,pro no favoritism
31559,michael,con you unzip your pants and you find that theres a calculator down there
31560,jim,ive been studying michael for years and ive condensed what ive learned into this chart pulls out a pie chart how michael spends his time as you can see we have procrastinating and distracting others and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking i made it bigger so that you could see it
31561,kevin,hey pam i heard that you were registered but i didnt hear where
31562,pam,i dont think we registered anywhere we just want cash
31563,kevin,like money like you you want my money

31569,kevin,wait til monday
31570,pam,is this what ive become materialistic shallow i feel horrible looks down at the check oh look mrs pam halpert thats the first time ive seen it in writing
31571,jim,you know the more i think about it the more i think we should give it to the salesmen
31572,michael,that will not go over well
31573,jim,i know i just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now course i know that this might come off as biased so you know what let us
31574,michael,oh my god are you gonna make another pro and con list im gonna kill myself
31575,jim,im not gonna let you stop me from thinking
31576,michael,no i could not do that jim i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect if i can just think this through if i could just think it exactly right i can make this perfect and then i can go down every avenue and every avenue off of that avenue and then another avenue
31577,jim,michael
31578,michael,and then another
31579,jim,look you have a lot of strengths
31580,michael,oh i do tell me what they are
31581,jim,i think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well
31582,michael,ha that i am not known for that
31583,jim,but there is a reason why im here
31584,michael,yes you went over my head to wallace
31585,jim,no its because you also have a lot of weaknesses michael
31586,michael,okay well why dont you tell me what those are jim why dont you enliven me
31587,jim,i dont think youre good at making tough decisions
31588,michael,ah
31589,jim,at thinking out the options and then stating that decision very clearly especially when its an unpopular decision
31590,michael,okay heres a tough decision for you you suck you suck is that clear enough for you
31591,jim,but maybe im here for a reason because i might have some good ideas too ive been sitting out there and ive been learning a lot and maybe i can just bring something different to the table
31592,michael,okay skippy here we go why dont you run yourself out there and tell them laughs you call it
31593,jim,leave the conference room to address everyone
31594,michael,to the camera this had better be terrible
31595,jim,could i have everyones attention please i have some tough news so im just gonna give it to you straight truth is we only have so much money for raises this year so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people wont now what weve decided is we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff
31596,meredith,wait seriously
31597,jim,look you guys are smart so im just leveling with you im just trying to treat you like adults
31598,oscar,thank you jim for thinking that were smart people
31599,angela,but i do not understand if were such smart adults then why dont we get raises
31600,oscar,excellent question genius its because jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with
31601,jim,ooh easy thats not it at all
31602,oscar,well
31603,jim,really what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the office
31604,kelly,walks in from shopping with bags in her hands whats going on
31605,kevin,jim is only giving raises to the salesmen
31606,kelly,what the hell why are you being such a jerk
31607,oscar,hold on kelly would it help you to know that jim thinks youre smart
31608,kelly,no puts down her bags how is that gonna repair ryans car
31609,dwight,this is ridiculous how could he do this to us
31610,jim,okay dwight you know what youd be getting the raise so
31611,dwight,what about all these people huh how is it fair to them
31612,oscar,exactly
31613,kevin,totally
31614,oscar,we work just as hard as the sales people we deserve raises
31615,creed,yes
31616,angela,yes they dont get em if we dont get em
31617,meredith,my kid needs shoes you want to tell him he doesnt get shoes
31618,kevin,yeah
31619,dwight,her kid needs shoes jim
31620,meredith,what the hell everyone complaining at jim
31621,jim,wow im just gonna rewind and back off a bit so imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles michael comes over by jim laughing
31622,michael,that was good that was good okay all right well we all know its hard to be a boss right you know what look around you these are your best friends these are the people who will open their hearts to you they all have heartons for you someone growns in disgust and that is a gift so in terms of gifts we should be giving each other gifts angela yes lend oscar a cup of sugar this
31623,angela,what are you talking about michael
31624,stanley,we just need to hear your plan for our raise
31625,michael,my plan a man panama
31626,andy,thats not how that goes
31627,meredith,youre not saying anything at least jim was being direct
31628,jim,thank you meredith
31629,meredith,when he was telling us his dumbass plan
31630,oscar,we would just like to know whats happening are we getting a raise yes or no
31631,michael,alright let me get this clear does everybody want a raise all say yes alright everyone wants a raise so what were going to do is go into here and we will not come out until we do
31632,oscar,again that gives us no information
31633,phyllis,this isnt a game you know its our livelihood
31634,michael,what about a raise based on merit
31635,jim,rank each person individually
31636,michael,mmhmm piece of cake ryan obviously the best
31637,jim,sarcastically well obviously too bad hes a temp and doesnt count so lets get started starts to write on a piece of paper
31638,michael,are you making a
31639,jim,nope im numbering the paper
31640,oscar,everyone talking to the camera just
31641,kevin,yeah i dont understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us
31642,angela,its not like were not gonna see the checks were in accounting
31643,meredith,i am so pissed at this company
31644,dwight,out the side of his mouth and jim
31645,meredith,yeah who said that
31646,dwight,i think it was creed
31647,creed,yep
31648,jim,to camera its going really well actually
31649,jim,to camera holds up a bean each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise we each got  beans so the idea is you place the bean on the picture walking around the table of who you think deserv whos that picture that michael drew of toby looks like a monster
31650,michael,toby
31651,jim,hes not a part of this you know that
31652,michael,just wanted to draw a picture of him
31653,jim,okay your move
31654,michael,alright who to pick walking around the table who to pick
31655,jim,here we go
31656,michael,i will skip a turn
31657,jim,okay youre gonna still have to play that bean you know that
31658,michael,i need more time
31659,erin,wallace sent an email about a meeting next week he wants you both to respond michael and jim leave dwight sneaks in
31660,dwight,people are starting to notice how terrible jim is its great eventually theyll rise up and revolt my only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later if the people here were our founding fathers the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years because stanley washington was napping and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly
31661,dwight,come on in everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table   thats right come in feast your eyes they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces
31662,oscar,what the hell
31663,dwight,things were not this bad when just michael was manager
31664,michael,hey what are you guys doing in here
31665,kevin,what does a bean mean
31666,pam,why arent there any beans on this very old frizzyhaired picture of me
31667,kevin,michael what does a bean mean
31668,pam,jim
31669,jim,i was just trying to be unbiased
31670,kevin,what does a bean mean
31671,oscar,someone please explain it to kevin
31672,meredith,why cant you my time is just as valuable as yours
31673,phyllis,not according to the beans
31674,angela,this is how you make this important decision
31675,andy,theres no way that stanley gets more beans than me starts to take stanleys beans stanley swats andys hand with his crossword puzzle that is ridiculous this is how it works everyone continues to argue
31676,phyllis,its not so much that i might not get a raise its just demeaning
31677,andy,thank you that is exactly by the way i would also like a raise
31678,phyllis,yeah i would too
31679,dwight,are we idiots gets up starts walking around what right does jim have to claim authority hmm is he as good a salesman as i is he as matronly as phyllis there are moments where we can affect change for a few seconds every decade we exist and these are those seconds let us storm his castle come on tick lets get him tock lets get jim tick and drag jim out of his office tock take his keys away from him tick thats a clock the time is getting very close its now or never what say you
31680,phyllis,i say no
31681,dwight,no i mean what do you say to my plan all groan okay
31682,michael,leaving his office hurrying to jims office

31692,michael,yes we did
31693,jim,i just what

31716,jim,we would really appreciate it
31717,dwight,pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy if she eats something the fetus doesnt like she is screwed its amazing a three ounce fetus is calling the shots its so bad ass
31718,pam,phyllis if you could switch to a different soap just for a month or two yours is kind of perfumy
31719,phyllis,now this is getting ridiculous
31720,dwight,oh gee im sorry i guess i missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant no i reserve the right to peel my hardboiled eggs at my desk
31721,meredith,all morning i look forward to my afternoon cigars and im not stopping for anyone
31722,pam,i dont think im asking for too much i guess its just the end of courtesy in the workplace
31723,andy,dwight peels a hardboiled egg at his desk sniffs it and takes a bite pam stares at him picks up her trash can and pukes into it watching people get sick always makes me sick and frankly so does talking about it so wow  andy phyllis meredith erin oscar and angela all proceed to throw up in various places while creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles dwight stares shocked pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look

31940,michael,thats not appropriate hello hi everybody i promised i wasnt gonna make a toast and im not going to just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to pam and jim then so be it hey what is the deal with the smart car how smart is that those things are tiny can you even drive them in traffic im so smart emc squared i drive a smart car thats not smart in my book the real smart car is kitt from knight rider
31941,dwight,knight rider
31942,michael,thats a car that can talk can smart car talk nope
31943,dwight,no
31944,michael,thats not smart and also chitty chitty bang bang no one is laughing
31945,dwight,very smart
31946,michael,and you everybody can laugh it doesnt have to just be the idiots everybody can laugh
31947,jim,no
31948,michael,yeah go ahead
31949,jim,alright hey everyone thanks for coming
31950,pete,douche
31951,jim,aw thanks pete that was really nice i just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight and i want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight especially the flordia cousins who obviously cant take a hint laughter four years ago i was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend and i had to do the hardest thing that ive ever had to do which was just to wait uh dont get me wrong i flirted with her pam i can now admit in front of my friends and family that i do know how to make a photo copy didnt need your help that many times and do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick
31952,pam,like a year
31953,jim,ive been driving stick since high school so yes for a really long time thats all i had i just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend and a lot of people told me i was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who i worked with but i think even then i knew that i was waiting for my wife so  i would like to propose a toast so if youd all raise your glasses not pam for obvious reasons but everyone else if you would raise your glasses
31955,jim,pam cant drink i didnt i shouldnt have said that i dont know why i did she can do whatever she wants though she shouldnt she shouldnt because shes an alcoholic pam is an alcoholic thats not true i no what we want the real reason is that that pams pregnant
31956,michael,clears throat ok ok hey what i think jim is trying to say is that they had an accident and you know what these two people theyre living together theyre having lots of consentual sex
31958,michael,yes yes they were living together yes and you know what you cant expect them to be careful every time because frankly its just a different sensation
31959,jim,michael
31960,michael,when you c well am i wrong they say its not different but its a different sensation
31961,jim,oh my god please
31962,michael,when you use something to block i think everybody knows what i am talking about its not necessarily different for the woman
31963,pam,michael
31964,michael,but its different for the ok ok
31965,pam,michael stop
31966,michael,alright my point is i said what i wanted to say and mema i hope you heard every word

31974,jim,i cant believe it was me
31975,michael,i know i cant believe it was you either i actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me
31976,jim,is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things
31977,michael,i have not found that to be the case
31978,pam,hey smooth guys

32558,andy,are you saying
32559,dwight,yeah
32560,andy,that we surgically remove the fear center from michaels brain
32561,dwight,what is wrong with you i am talking about convincing michael that the guys not mafia
32562,andy,that seems a little farfetched
32563,dwight,well more farfetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a lowlevel shakedown  and that happened
32564,dwight,michael incredible news grotti is clean
32565,michael,no hes not hes just good nothing sticks to him you still dont understand how this works
32566,andy,no michael what were trying to say is we made a mistake assuming he was mafia i have a buddy whos a fed and we did a background check on the guy  his background is perfectly clean
32567,dwight,its true hes clean i have a couple of friends still on the force checked with them ran his fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasnt on the take turns out hes a totally lovely guy sweetest guy on the force really
32568,andy,class act boy scout
32569,michael,but grotti acts like hes mafia though
32570,andy,hes trying to intimidate you to close sales hes just a pushy salesman
32571,dwight,and he made us all look like chumps
32572,michael,grunts
32573,michael,if there is one thing i hate more than the mafia it is a liar i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars bury them in my yard and i wouldnt tell the cops a thing not that i would be lying per se but i would just get really quiet all of a sudden
32574,creed,this is grotti
32575,michael,this is scott
32576,creed,oh great michael im finishing up your paperwork right now
32577,michael,oh really is that supposed to scare me

32579,michael,well you thought wrong because i am not pleased im actually kind of pod
32580,creed,what
32581,michael,i think you know exactly why because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance
32582,creed,i dont get it how was i scaring you
32583,michael,i think you knew exactly what you were doing and frankly i think you were being a total and utter jerk
32584,andy,whoa okay
32585,michael,you suck
32586,dwight,okay thats
32587,michael,and im not gonna buy your stupid insurance

32597,michael,what
32598,dwight,you successfully backed down the mob
32599,andy,you made the mafia apologize to you you made the mafia be polite
32600,michael,oh man i should be mad at you guys but im not
32601,michael,so i looked him in the eye and i said not today grotti not today and not tomorrow and not the next day or the day after that and you can tell all your friends that if i see them then theyre already dead i said something like that

33621,dwight,screaming phyllis and dwight wrestling  got you  broken arm  boom boom boom  broken nose boom boom boom boom  broken nose  boom  ha gonna flip you
33622,jim,once a year dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate because as we all know the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change
33623,dwight,how can i pose this to you in a relatable way  you are all members of the yakuza and you happen to be visiting the lackawanna trolley museum and you are attacked by triads how can you hold them off until your clan arrives  you cannot go wrong with a throat punch screams pretends to punch meredith in the throat
33624,jim,ok so theres no defense for that good to know
33625,dwight,no there is a defense for that  let me demonstrate  someone attack me  kevin go
33626,kevin,no way  last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace
33627,dwight,false  i did choke you with your shoelace  now come at me
33628,jim,ok with all due respect to everyone here i think the most worthy opponent of you is you
33629,dwight,that is correct  unless there happened to be measles present
33630,jim,so lets just say that dwight has come at you with the throat punch  now how would you dwight defend against it
33631,dwight,easy  allow me to demonstrate  i am attacking myself with a throat punch  here it comes gives himself a fake throat punch  block  grasp wrist as such grasps wrist
33632,jim,and what if he comes at you with the other hand because he does have two
33633,dwight,good point  second throat punch absorb the blow gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself  groin punch hip block elbow to the gut  uh oh up to the nose  no youre not  ow  oh
33634,jim,oh my god hes making you look like such a fool
33635,dwight,he really is but not for long  steps on foot  ow instep oh not again  more screaming you let go you let go  oh youre right i cant hold on
33636,jim,you two are so evenly matched i dont know how one of you is going to get the upper hand
33637,dwight,the important thing to remember jim we always have what is called the element of surprise hits himself in the groin and moans
33638,michael,but i would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy
33639,andy,i did stand up comedy once
33640,michael,you did
33641,andy,yeah i killed
33642,michael,that sounds like it was hilarious
33643,andy,it was hilarious
33644,dwight,michael
33645,michael,yes
33646,dwight,what is the meaning of this email that everyone got
33647,michael,youll have to be more specific dwight i get like eight emails a day
33648,dwight,this one from david wallace to all dunder mifflin
33649,michael,woo hoo shout out
33650,dwight,hello everyone i am sure you have seen the item in the journal  i just want to stress that its all conjecture  if theres any concrete news you will know asap

33654,pam,michael he means the wall street journal online
33655,michael,oh the wall
33656,oscar,i found the article everyone walks over to his desk he begins reading the article  on a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings one that is relatively not surprising is dunder mifflins  it is rumored that they will recommend  and the article cuts off
33657,michael,its  to finish the article  i wonder what it was going to say no one makes a move to pay for the article

33659,andy,i got it i got it oh tuna beat me to it
33660,phyllis,it is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy
33661,michael,no no that doesnt make any sense
33662,stanley,oh lord were all gonna lose our jobs
33663,oscar,not necessarily bankruptcy could mean a lot of things  maybe theyre just restructuring to get out of debt
33664,michael,oh that sounds awful
33665,oscar,or it could mean the end of dunder mifflin
33666,michael,oh god  well thats an interesting theory
33667,dwight,you know what  you can all have jobs at schrute farms as human scarecrows  it doesnt pay much and you cant unionize
33669,michael,ah well maybe you should spy on him  in valley girl voice oh my god wouldnt that be hilarious laughs
33671,michael,ok ok  good  ill catch you on the flippity flip  bye hangs up phone  hes busy hell call me back when hes free

33677,andy,i like erin there i said it  i was kinda hoping she would ask me out but things have not panned out on that front so it is time for the nard dog to take matters into his own paws
33678,jim,michael in his office playing music loudly jim walks in and turns the volume down michael trailing off on singing  we have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering whats going to happen
33679,michael,ok we need some sort of distraction for everybody  anything new on youtube  doesnt even need to be good  oh god i cant think need more mullins
33680,jim,listen wallace said these were just rumors right so we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine  so if we just go on with our work you and me theyll follow along
33681,michael,monkey see monkey do
33682,jim,thats it
33683,michael,monkey pee all over you

33693,meredith,reading the game box cover belles bourbon and bullets a murder mystery dinner party game
33694,michael,it is so much fun  everybody plays a character we go around the room we try to figure out who did it

33699,jim,comanaging is a give and take  you have to pick your battles  one of the battles that i picked was to stop michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them  he was going to call it tube city so yes i do owe him one

33707,michael,ok here are your character cards  take one pass it down here is your prop box some of your characters will have props  now on your character card it tells you who you are and what your alibi is  everything else is up to your imagination  so if you talk slowly in real life your character could say have been kicked in the head by a horse

33709,michael,ok use your imaginations
33710,andy,whod you get

33749,andy,in character hey there young lady
33750,erin,hello
33751,andy,i would be remiss if i did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend
33752,erin,sounds like a plan sugar
33753,andy,alright a plan it is
33754,dwight,voodoo mama juju explain your dalliance with the dark arts
33755,angela,its not my fault i was exposed to harry potter
33756,dwight,i know you did it
33757,dwight,i know she didnt do it  its never the person you most suspect its also never the person you least suspect since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most  therefore i know the killer to be phyllis aka beatrix bourbon the person i most medium suspect
33758,kevin,in character do you want to go out on a date with me  we can make out by the horses
33759,erin,well you know ol nellies always up for a romp in the hay
33760,meredith,how about a threesome
33761,erin,yeah my boudoirs always open
33762,kevin,nice
33763,andy,im a little worried i might have asked out naughty nellie and not erin  which would be a whole lot less appealing because naughty nellie says yes to everyone  and she might be a murderer
33764,oscar,i just got an email from corporate specifically for accounting to stop all payments to our vendors
33765,phyllis,what does that mean
33766,oscar,well maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity
33767,michael,accent whoa whats this strange yankee accent coming out of your mouth son  this heres savannah
33768,oscar,tries to speak in a highpitched southern accent this plantation were running low on greenbacks  were having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt  we cant pay in regular voice  michael i cant  basically it could mean a lot of things but it is unprecedented so its cause for concern
33769,jim,ok im going back to work
33770,michael,no no no no no no no accent im going to skip forward to a relevant clue  here we go
33772,phyllis,michael i was doing so well
33773,michael,accent are you going to believe that that is a mis thats a misdirection  we still dont know who the murderer is  everyone leaves nellie nutmeg come back in here  i cant do this myself  voodoo mama juju what am i gonna do
33774,jim,ok so corporate is still in their meeting
33775,kevin,that could be a good sign
33776,angela,hey everyone kevins going to give us his take on the situation  lets listen up
33777,jim,alright guys its a work day and you guys work here so lets go do some work
33778,kevin,now jim telling us all to work  i think that is a very good sign

33851,dwight,oh this could be a juicy one
33852,michael,get in there
33853,jim,i think today was a good day to have two managers  cause if youre a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean one parent might want to just keep rowing  but if the other parent wants to play a game its not because theyre crazy  its because theyre doing it for the kids  and i get that now
33854,michael,there has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue  my little heart can barely take it no more  regular voice today is the hardest i have worked in a long long time
33855,andy,andy michael and dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other i didnt do it

33864,jim,michael dwight andy and now pam are in the circle and training their weapons on each other jim walks in  really
33865,pam,accent it wasnt me  im not goin down for this
33866,jim,yeah i want to go home

33868,oscar,dwight enters dressed as recyclops not again
33869,dwight,bow down before recyclops
33870,jim,five years ago corporate said we had to start a recycling program for earth day so dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named recyclops
33871,dwight,happy earth day everyone im recyclops did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter
33872,jim,the next year he really stepped things up
33873,dwight,who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin
33874,jim,a year after that recylcops really began to take shape
33875,dwight,recylops will drown you in your overwatered lawns
33876,jim,then tragedy struck recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing i cant remember
33877,dwight,recyclops will have his revenge
33878,jim,i think this was also the year he renounced earth day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved
33879,pam,oh my god you guys look its recyclops
33880,dwight,recyclops destroys starts tearing through the office
33881,stanley,oh is today recyclops day
33882,dwight,yes
33883,stanley,i thought you were killed by polluticorn
33884,dwight,polluticorn wishes starts spraying the office with something
33885,andy,thats aerosol spray its terrible for the environment
33886,dwight,humans are terrible for the environment
33887,pam,the thing i like most about recyclops is that hes creating a different world for our child
33888,jim,mmm
33889,pam,a world where you truly can be anything you want
33890,jim,god bless you recyclops and your cold robot heart dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses

34190,michael,well technically im a comanager and i barely have any responsibilities but i work hard i love this company and for those reasons i think i would make a good employee of the month
34191,jim,it would look bad  sorry

34215,michael,just tell me it is going to be okay all right
34216,pam,no
34217,michael,im not a bad person i bring good news  like when i promised those kids id pay for college  okay all right

34230,jim,let me guess you think you should get it
34231,dwight,this encompasses all available data  hours tardiness unconfirmed sick days participation  everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency  also this should be accompanied by a monetary prize

34233,dwight,in an ideal world i would have all ten fingers on my left hand so my right hand could just be a fist for punching
34234,jim,okay if its all the same to you im just going to take away survival skills and selfdefense
34235,dwight,im going to run this by toby and accounting and have him assemble the data

34266,kevin,jim said that
34267,dwight,he thought you were doing an incredible job last month
34268,kevin,jim said that
34269,dwight,you seem suprised
34270,kevin,no no that makes total sense
34271,dwight,hey buddy so every
34272,oscar,sure puts in the twenty
34273,dwight,five minutes ahead of schedule  right on schedule
34276,michael,crying oh god  oh god
34277,jim,okay ladies and gentlemen welcome  i know youre all very excited but no matter who gets this i just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes  and the winner is employee number nine  and that is
34278,andy,number nine number nine  jim halpert
34279,everyone,huh  what
34280,oscar,are you kidding me
34281,dwight,oh no
34282,jim,okay wait i was not i did not
34283,kevin,i i i did not that was not how come not
34284,jim,guys listen  this was anonymous all right  there is no way i couldve given it to myself because i didnt even know who was on here  i just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score
34285,angela,to my tally you just won back your own parking spot a vacation day and a nice tidy quarter of  from all of us
34286,jim,will everybody stop for a second because obviously im not taking any of it  a mistake has been made and well figure it out  second of all there was no cash prize
34287,angela,yes
34288,jim,dwight
34289,dwight,yeah you said in an ideal world there would be a cash prize  isnt that what you said
34290,jim,no dwight i meant yes in a perfect world someone would get money  but
34291,phyllis,yeah but in your perfect world only you get money
34293,michael,all right  wow  um i am never going to forget today  not a chance  i dont think i could ever give back to you what you have given me today  who here has done something stupid in their lives  like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between a gym and b gym that sort of thing  show of hands anybody yes a bunch of you okay  well me too ive done something stupid which i would like to share  ummm period bell rings should we go
34295,michael,ah  all right  i came here today because i promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable  but you know whats invaluable is intuition  you know what that is  that is the ability to know when something is about to happen  does anybody out there have intuition  know whats gonna happen next  nobody  okay youre going to make me say it  all right i am so proud of all of you  derrick and lefevre and ben and ayana and mikela and nikki and jason and im sorry okay sorry spacing your name
34297,michael,well zion i am not going to be paying for your college tuition  which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybodys tuition  im so so sorry
34298,michael,im sorry  im sorry  im so sorry
34299,michael,you lied to us
34300,michael,i lied to myself too  im not a millionaire  i thought i would be by the time i was  but i wasnt even close  and then i thought maybe by the time i was  but by  i had less money than when i was   maybe by my s i dont know  i wanted to pay for your education  i really did  it was my dream  some people have evil drems some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams  my dream was in the right place
34302,michael,okay hold on  hold on  now i cant pay for your college  but you dont have to go to class to be in class  online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience  and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop students perk up which is rendered useless without batteries and i have one for each of you
34304,michael,hey holdhold on hold on hold on hold on  theyre lithium
34305,jim,look there was a big mistake obviously so i will fix it  okay  this was your idea anyway
34306,andy,correction  it was my idea
34307,jim,okay
34308,dwight,my idea
34309,creed,guys im starting to think pams not really even pregnant
34310,pam,ok for the record i am pregnant and obviously there has been some kind of a mistake so why doesnt jim just pick the next highest score on the list and well move on
34311,phyllis,thats fair
34312,dwight,excellent idea pam
34313,pam,thank you
34314,andy,that would be employee number three which would be son of a bitch pam halpert
34315,phyllis,how is that possible  no offense pam but how the hell is that possible
34316,dwight,there must be some reasonable explanation for this
34317,pam,no wait come on  i didnt miss a day i came in early i stayed late and i doubled my sales last month
34318,andy,oh really from what two to four
34319,pam,yup
34320,jim,guys this isnt some elaborate scam okay
34322,jim,okay  that is me but i didnt order the cake
34323,kevin,look who it is shows camera the cake which has a picture of jim
34324,angela,it could only be you  way to go
34325,dwight,he knew all along

34350,david,david
34351,jim,hey uh david
34352,david,yes
34353,jim,so there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today  its been a little wild uh but i am on it

34380,erin,the principal told me that  of scotts tots are on track to graduate and thats  higher than the rest of the school  so i think if you hadnt made that promise a lot of them wouldve dropped out  which is something to think about i think
34381,michael,i think youre doing a great job
34382,erin,really
34383,michael,what do you want from this job provided the company doesnt go out of business

34953,stanley,thats ok
34954,michael,there is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company but  percent of me is water and the other part the real part the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and if i can be crass makes babies that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba

35271,jo,well i think youre both being a little too modest
35272,jim,no i really really think michael is better at being manager for so many reasons
35273,michael,no i think i would be bad i would sleep in my office and i would sexually harass people

35294,dwight,i have an old barn
35295,ryan,yes

35297,ryan,we do what they did in saw  i mean we dont kill him obviously i have a mask
35298,dwight,okay thats your idea exactly like in the movie that is the most idiotic thing i have ever heard in my life

35314,ryan,like frodo
35315,dwight,why dont you just let me handle the tolkien references okay dumb jock
35316,ryan,well i think he can be corrupted like gollum
35317,dwight,smeagol was corrupted and became gollum

35319,erin,whos hungry

35430,dwight,i need a baby  ill never outsell jim and pam without one  also ive been noticing a gaping hole in my life  sometimes i wake up cradling a gourd
35431,pam,kevin youre such a gourmand
35432,kevin,i cooked my way through julia childs cookbook and now im halfway through the twilight cookbook  last night i had edwards corn flake chicken
35433,pam,hmm
35434,kevin,pregnant pam and i we get hungry at the same times so weve been eating together a lot  not all meals  just second breakfast lunch second lunch and first dinner
35435,kevin,i thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner  one last ultra feast
35436,pam,mmmm that sounds great  what are you thinking
35437,kevin,i think it should be a surprise
35438,meredith,after pam has a contraction  oh getting there huh
35439,pam,no no  i still have time
35440,pam,im having contractions but theyre irregular and far apart  so im not really in labor im near labor
35441,jim,yeah were slowplaying it because of our stupid hmo
35442,pam,if we check in after midnight i get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors
35443,jim,not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home if its crying all night one of us is going to have to take care of it  and i do not plan on helping unless its a boy
35444,pam,i cannot wait for that joke to be over
35445,pam,ooh
35446,michael,oh oh oh  contraption  shes contrapting  okay you know what  i think i should drive you guys to the hospital and here is why  i am a licensed classy driver in the state of pennsylvania  i gassed up the car
35447,jim,michael
35448,michael,actually i put diesel in this time trying to save some money
35449,jim,michael you shouldnt have done that
35450,michael,happy to do it  also i did a heck of a job babyproofing this office
35451,pam,you know the babys not going to live here right
35452,michael,well the baby was conceived here so might as well live here a little bit too
35453,jim,hmm that logics airtight but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here  burning man portopotty
35454,michael,oh yuck  tmi  how was it  i dont want to know  tell me later  lets go  lets go  hospital
35455,pam,okay okay were not going to the hospital  we are waiting until midnight
35456,erin,ooh spooky  but why
35457,jim,because the insurance company only covers two nights
35458,pam,everythings fine  we have plenty of time
35459,nick,well you dont want to wait too long pam  otherwise the babys going to become a teenager in there and youll be up all night from the rock music
35460,michael,shut up nick  what a weird thing to say  weird it nerd  dont get revenge on me nerd
35461,angela,as nick looks over at her  what are you looking at
35462,dwight,ha nerd
35463,kelly,did you know that labor can last weeks  then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table and sometimes epidurals dont work and you can poop yourself
35464,dwight,with angela in the break room  bare my child
35465,angela,excuse me
35466,dwight,i want to have a child for business reasons and i want you to be the mother  if you agree say nothing  if you disagree say anything  very well  lets meet at  pm at our old meeting spot and bang it out
35467,jim,after pam has another contraction  thats seven minutes  here we go  this is happening  come on
35468,pam,hold on hold on  it isnt midnight yet
35469,jim,are you serious  pam
35470,pam,no the doctor said every five to seven minutes
35471,jim,i  pam please
35472,pam,im going to be okay we should really try to make it until midnight
35473,andy,yeah no you really should  because if your babys born tomorrow hes going to have the same birthday as buttmud brooks  my old roommate
35474,pam,did you hear that  buttmud brooks
35475,jim,okay but we are leaving at five minutes apart
35476,pam,five minutes apart
35477,jim,so the plan was seven minutes  but were calling an audible because thats her call  because shes the quarterback  im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant
35478,pam,okay stop watching me
35479,jim,okay crazy  i think i have some better things to do with my day than worry about you like sell printers
35480,pam,mmhmm
35481,jim,well not until friday  off toner cartridges thats a big deal  while were on the subject why dont i just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check
35482,pam,not until midnight
35483,andy,guys  word of advice  speaking as a former baby  dont get too hung up on baby names  i was named walter jr after my father until i was about six or so when my parents changed their minds
35484,erin,i thought you said your younger brother was named walter jr
35485,andy,my brother was born and my parents felt he better exemplified the walter jr name so they gave it to him  i was given andrew which they got out of a baby name book
35486,jim,you know its getting real crowded in here  maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet
35487,michael,no no no no no  you know what  you cant tell us what to do because you are not comanager anymore
35488,jim,as andy and kevin shout yeah in response to michael okay i feel like this noise is going to prevent pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals
35489,pam,actually the distractions are good  i mean i dont think im going to make it until midnight if im just sitting here thinking about it
35490,michael,distractions are good  that means conference room five minutes  no no five seconds  right now right now  conference room  topic potpourri  lets go
35491,michael,um i am sort of a master of distraction  when i was a kid my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class  try to think what were the first thirteen colonies  mmhmm mmhmm  michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises
35492,michael,the purpose for this meeting is to take pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body
35493,andy,can we do sleight of hand tricks
35494,michael,i will allow that
35495,andy,yes  can anyone do those

35506,michael,as pam shakes her head nope nope i dont think anybody wants to see that
35507,andy,i can do the evolution of dancedance
35508,michael,as pam gives the thumbs up  that sounds good  do you need some music or  okay
35509,andy,nope actually music would just throw me off  i need complete silence  okay  pam begins to clap as andy dances  youre clapping  i need complete silence  totally threw me off so im going to have to start over  evolution of dancedance
35510,ryan,reading from a book as kelly admires  you let me in your bed  but now i sleep alone  trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home
35511,erin,naming race horses  affirmed  seattle slew  secretariat  citation  assault  count fleet  whirlaway  war admiral  omaha  gallant fox  and  i know this  uh  the jockey was johnny loftus  sired by star shoot

37129,andy,specific shoutout
37130,michael,stop talking
37131,andy,ok as some of you may know i have a very special connection with secretarys day in the form of that  pound moonbeam over there named erin hannon to a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations but to me she is my girlfriend in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations so i wrote starts to use a british accent a little ditty that i would like to play for all of you right now its a little tune called secretary of love a one a two a one two three
37132,erin,throws a piece of cake at andys face i know about angela i know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her michael told me
37133,michael,oh god
37134,andy,can we talk about this in private
37135,erin,i dont want to be in private is it true or is it not
37136,andy,yes
37137,erin,who else did you sleep with did you sleep with phyllis or kelly or pam maybe all together
37138,pam,no no never
37139,erin,did everyone know was i the only one who didnt know
37140,dwight,yeah pretty much
37141,erin,who are you i dont know you pushes someone away to leave
37142,gabe,i should probably get involved in this but i think my energy is better spent on the cookie monster issue
37143,kevin,erin you know if i had been engaged to anyone before you i wouldve told you
37144,erin,thanks
37145,kevin,so if you need anything im right over there
37146,pam,imitating cookie monster hey erin you look delicious i mean beautiful
37147,gabe,ok ok there i heard that so im sorry pam but thats it im going to have to suspend you without pay for two days
37148,pam,what what do you mean suspend me
37149,jim,i think you need to go a little easy you cant just suspend someone form work
37150,gabe,yeah youre right you know what um youre suspended too jim dwight starts to clap ok fine you too dwight
37151,dwight,wait what i was just slowclapping your nononsense decisionmaking
37152,gabe,i dont want to hear it suspended
37153,kevin,c is for suspension
37154,andy,why would that be something to talk about on secretarys day
37155,michael,andy shes not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with all right and besides who doesnt tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them thats like thats like mr and mrs smith crap
37156,andy,i was going to tell her just on my own time
37157,michael,you know what i resent the implication that i would keep that secret everyone here knows that i cant and wont keep a secret
37158,andy,who cares i mean its not like i killed someone big deal right this can blow over in two seconds she never asked me so if you think about it i probably should have told her i guess everybody does stupid things
37159,angela,psst hey erin
37160,erin,you want to talk to me come to my desk
37161,angela,you embarrassed me earlier
37162,erin,oh take it up with the chief of police
37163,angela,you think i want people remembering i had sensual relations with andy its the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled i want to throw up just thinking about it
37164,erin,i want to throw up just thinking about it
37165,angela,you are throwing up for the wrong reasons
37166,toby,standing behind erin i dont think this fax is going through is there a different i can just put it through again you know
37167,pam,hey you know i was engaged before jim
37168,erin,really
37169,pam,yeah and he worked here too
37170,erin,it was andy wasnt it
37171,pam,no no it wasnt andy it wasnt it doesnt matter its not about who youve been with its about who you end up with sometimes the heart doesnt know what it wants until it finds what it wants
37172,erin,i hope you find what youre looking for
37173,pam,thank you kisses jim on the cheek
37174,gabe,talking on the phone so i can reprimand them but i cant suspend them oh i cant do either uh huh fair enough
37175,pam,answers phone hey toby

37177,pam,very interesting
37178,toby,yeah i also learned some interesting things about how they structure
37179,pam,gabe walks in thanks toby
37180,gabe,hey everyone hi quite an afternoon huh cathartic in a way im glad i got to share it with you it makes you think about whats really important pam hands jim a note its not about showing youre in charge or flexing some sort of authority its about forgiveness and yes im talking about you three in this desk clump right here i think that if you were to apologize to me then i would revoke your suspension
37181,pam,i dont think an apology is enough i really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension
37182,jim,and i got to take this bad attitude and i got to go home and i got to adjust it and i hope the suspension does that
37183,dwight,gets up and walks towards gabe prideful idiots watch how its done jim and pam get their things together and start to leave gabriel i apologize
37184,gabe,great
37185,dwight,gets on one knee i kneel before you
37186,gabe,guys i would even take a contrite look as an apology
37187,dwight,humbly taking your hand upon which i kiss to show my contrition
37188,gabe,following jim and pam to their car guys to err is human trying to block their car
37189,erin,trust is the most important thing to me is your name andy bernard whats your real name lionel frankenstein
37190,andy,will you stop walking for one second thats it theres no other secrets ok i mean yeah my chest is not naturally hairless and my parents pay my credit card bill

37307,dwight,one minority from this branch is going to get into this program who would i refer hmm the competent hardworking one who does things his own way or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines
37308,kelly,on phone this is the second time that youve sent me the wrong size i mean i know what a four feels like ive been a four my whole life you know what you can go to hell all right thanks for nothing

37311,dwight,well you can kinda tell from the voice
37312,kelly,yeah
37313,dwight,i bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot just because of your race
37314,kelly,well they say its because of texting but maybe youre right
37315,dwight,i think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program
37316,kelly,never thought of myself as an executive before
37317,dwight,i know cause you have no role models how many indian ceos can you think of
37318,kelly,i cant think of any ceos any race
37319,dwight,you could be the indian bill gates you could be the indian ted turner
37320,kelly,i could be the indian julia roberts
37321,dwight,thats not shes okay yes
37322,michael,i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier and i want to show you there we go michaels picture pops up on the powerpoint screen whoa look at those vivid colors look at my eyes those are shrekgreen eyes that is me again i think this displays the crisp dazzling white
37323,donna,mmhmm
37324,michael,and that would be a display image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up of the crisp gorgeous black
37325,donna,yeah
37326,michael,its subtle thats how it works i show her an image that turns her on and then she looks at me then back at me then back at the image soon she doesnt know what is me what is the image she just knows that shes turned on
37327,michael,this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts ive never taken anybody there before
37328,donna,who took the photo
37329,michael,ryan
37330,donna,oh michael quickly advances powerpoint show to last slide which is sex in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly

37332,donna,giggles not bad
37333,michael,oh thanks softly youre not bad either
37334,donna,thank you michael tries t kiss donna donna clears throat hmm

37336,donna,oh my god realizing jim and pam are looking through the conference room windows
37337,michael,jim could you come in here for a sec what was that printer we were looking at
37338,michael,in his office you didnt see it pam she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move shortbread
37339,jim,no
37340,pam,ill have one
37341,jim,well maybe you shouldnt try to kiss people at work
37342,michael,oh really jim what about pam and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss maybe this could be my pam
37343,jim,okay well all that is irrelevant
37344,pam,maybe michael has a point i mean if she was really that upset she wouldnt still be here
37345,donna,was it professional no but i work in the nightlife industry i get hit on all the time in my s it would have been annoying in my late s i find it really flattering
37346,michael,look i know that i screwed up in there i know that i probably messed up your sale i just want to go in and fix it
37347,pam,what if i back out and you finish the pitch with jim
37348,jim,what
37349,jim,what was that
37350,pam,just let him flirt with her people meet each other all sorts of ways
37351,jim,pam you know hes not gonna get anywhere and hes gonna blow our sale
37352,pam,who cares michael peeking at them through his office window its not that huge a sale
37353,jim,hey the schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale
37354,pam,dont act like you understood anything that guy said pats jims arm good luck wingman salutes
37355,dwight,how as being a minority affected you
37356,kelly,well theres a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an indian guy
37357,dwight,oh good and you resent this because
37358,kelly,indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants its so dorky
37359,dwight,oh no no thats not dorky dwight wears his phone like that look its easily accessible boom like this  hello scranton stranglers in the house inside the house
37360,kelly,just put it in your pocket
37362,kevin,looking it look at that shes totally flirting with him
37363,phyllis,you dont know that some people cant help oozing sexuality
37364,creed,you ever notice you can ooze two things sexuality and pus man i tell ya
37365,phyllis,she just crossed her arms together thats bad
37366,pam,maybe shes just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger
37367,kevin,tries it by crossing his arms like that to andy
37368,donna,is this is this the best you can do right there
37369,jim,uh for that printer yes unfortunately we dont have a lot of flexibility
37370,donna,oh well i guess im just used to the restaurant business removes sweater revealing her revealing top where if youre in charge then you can always get discounts for the people that you like
37371,jim,yeah chuckles
37372,michael,so maybe we could find a little wiggle room right
37373,jim,whats that
37374,michael,maybe wee find some wiggle room
37375,jim,i dont i dont think so
37376,michael,i think we could donna giggles
37377,oscar,i dont see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money delivery alone will cost
37378,michael,okay well sometimes sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money right like for tax purposes
37379,oscar,actually ran the numbers on this and in this case it makes more financial sense to gain money
37380,michael,why dont you run them again
37381,jim,what if shes just flirting with you to get a better price
37382,michael,if she is its working
37383,kevin,yeah michael heres a trick ask her if she wants a mint if she says no then she is not interested
37384,jim,she does not like him
37385,pam,you can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them how do you think we got together
37386,jim,cause i stopped by your desk like  times a day
37387,pam,i was after your money
37388,jim,well the joke was on you

37397,kelly,oh thats okay ryan coached me
37398,dwight,ryan what does he know
37399,ryan,its easy you just turn every question around on them do you think youre treated differently because of your race
37400,kelly,would you ask that same question if i was white were so in
37401,dwight,we
37402,kelly,when i become executive im gonna make ryan manager
37403,ryan,and then the two of us are cleanin house

38532,michael,nope it wont be gabe but actually there is somebody in the office that is very very close to luke
38533,dwight,how close
38534,michael,well dwight he wiped his butt is that close enough for you
38535,dwight,yes of course
38536,toby,guys i think michael and luke are related

38541,michael,yes exactly that is a very nice way of putting it oscar mixing family and business is a beautiful thing
38542,darryl,whats wrong with a level playing field
38543,michael,do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson what if no one named hanson showed up that wouldnt even make sense or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a yearold guy who was a murderer really safe
38544,jim,oh man so many points being made
38545,creed,i couldnt care less about nepotism but im loving the debate great minds battling it out and ive got a front row seat
38546,michael,god when he needed help on earth who did he hire jesus christ his son
38547,erin,thats a really tight argument
38548,michael,thank you
38549,jim,but youre comparing you and luke to god and jesus
38550,michael,no no im just saying why does god get to do something that i dont
38551,oscar,this is hypothetical were talking about luke who happens to be terrible
38552,michael,well then why arent you bugging me to fire everybody whos bad you just want me to fire luke thats reverse nepotism  he should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does
38553,kelly,i would just like to say something off of what darryl said about the level playing field that is actually a zoning issue so thank you
38554,oscar,if theres nothing wrong with this michael why have you been keeping it a secret
38555,michael,because i wanted you to come to me and say wow he is so great and i was gonna say well its in the genes and i was actually gonna be wearing jeans and id point to them right no but you ruined it so thank you very much here he comes guys look i dont want you to treat him like anyone else in the office i just want you to treat him like my nephew hey there he is

38747,pam,so what happened
38748,dwight,i went to the store and i pressed the buzzer and they looked right at me and then they looked away and then i pressed the buzzer again and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones i guess im not the kind of guy thats good enough for precious heirlooms

39292,phyllis,oh when you got your new phone thats when you asked for everyones attention

40163,darryl,this was your freshman year

40173,creed,best edward james olmos costume ive ever seen like freaky good
40174,pam,i know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately its that time of year and according to a study done by the university of arizona theyve discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat

40176,michael,thats true thats true i dated her momma and you know what
40177,jim,stop
40178,michael,under his breath um kay uh alright
40179,pam,one of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough
40180,erin,didid you say vampire
40181,pam,oh no its just that if a vampire had to cough he would do it like this coughs into elbow
40182,dwight,uhhuh right and ruin their cloaks do you have any idea how expensive wool is in transylvania looks at camera cause of the euro
40183,pam,well other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly dont come in if youre sick
40184,dwight,rolls his eyes and shakes his head uh
40185,pam,and get your flu shot also im going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office
40186,dwight,no no no they will cost you your life
40187,jim,elaborate
40188,dwight,the worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it they need to fight their own battles if sabre really cared about our wellbeing they would set up hand desanitizing stations a simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt vomit fecal matter
40189,pam,im not  im not going to do that im not going to do that
40190,dwight,exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger
40191,jim,so by that rationale if i had to sneeze i should just sneeze on you
40192,dwight,yes i would welcome it
40193,jim,sneezes on dwight looks at camera youre welcome
40194,dwight,the principle is sound to avoid illness expose yourself to germs enabling your immune system to develop antibodies i dont know why everyone doesnt do this maybe they have something against living forever

41315,oscar,we have missiles too
41316,michael,did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal but what do i know i mean thats just according to the pentagon our pentagon

41320,pam,well thanks
41321,nate,yeah
41322,michael,china has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars we are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives and they will control us

41652,pam,maybe i mean
41653,darryl,on the phone i just no she be talking to your mom or something this is my daughter too justine you seem to think justine hangs up oh pick a damn tree already
41654,pam,um hey darryl listen its none of my business but if i couldnt have cece for christmas id be really upset too
41655,andy,i dont have kids or anything but if my grandmother ever dies im going to kill myself
41656,darryl,jada dont want to spend christmas with me she told her mom it wasnt as much fun and how could she say that you know i took her to the toy store to buy her own presents
41657,pam,well darryl no kid wants to buy their own christmas presents
41658,darryl,her mom wants me to take her to mass i guess thats something to do
41659,pam,no you should have her mom do the boring christmas stuff on her time you should be associated with the fun parts of christmas
41660,darryl,how do i do that
41661,pam,bring her to the party yeah well have santa and well play games with her itll be a lot of fun
41662,andy,yes

41670,michael,its a sophisticated take
41672,darryl,no he doesnt to michael i told her santa would be here
41673,michael,yeah well i was told that holly would be here single and ready to date and we all got misled
41674,pam,who told you that
41675,michael,nora ephron in every romantic comedy ever made
41676,phyllis,so is it an open relationship
41677,holly,oh god no

41680,kelly,so wheres the ring
41681,pam,kelly um how are you adjusting to the move
41682,phyllis,nobody cares about that look you have to make him commit or kick his butt to the curb
41683,pam,you guys i dont think any of us are really qualified to be giving holly personal advice about her love life
41684,erin,yeah i mean maybe hollys not in any position to be shooing guys away
41685,erin,i dont get it im sorry i just i dont get it
41686,holly,okay listen im gonna tell him that if he doesnt propose by the end of this year were over
41687,pam,wow an ultimatum
41688,holly,yeah
41689,pam,it doesnt really seem like you
41690,kelly,that is a great idea ultimatums are key basically nobody does anything for me anymore unless i threaten to kill myself
41691,dwight,turns in pams chair with a pam wig on and laughs maniacally
41692,jim,dont stop dwight dwight pelts jim with snowballs dwight stop dwight stop
41693,dwight,oh no oh no

41700,jim,okay okay dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally
41701,dwight,yes i have a wig for every single person in the office you never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone
41702,jim,i just want it to stop
41703,pam,so cool right
41704,ryan,theres no connection between the origin story and the quest
41705,pam,okay
41706,ryan,we need to know who jimmy halpert was before he was bitten by the bear otherwise its the bears quest
41707,pam,okay well i just sorta meant like cute right
41708,ryan,well did you come here for help or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is
41709,pam,i mean help if its something simple like add page numbers or laminate it or
41710,ryan,well it sounds like you know what you want pam walks away its also a little derivative of a serias called bear man did you look that up
41711,pam,no
41712,ryan,okay
41713,toby,oh jim hey
41714,jim,hey toby
41715,toby,theres this female uh uh stenographer at the courthouse
41716,jim,no way
41717,toby,who looks exactly like you
41718,jim,thats increadible
41719,toby,yeah no its uncanny
41720,jim,you know whats crazy
41721,toby,what
41722,jim,i cant reconnect with you right now hold on one second he hurls a snowball at dwight with a lacrosse stick misses and shatters a window everyone gasps excuse me clears throat
41723,michael,i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer and some people you dont and thats just the way it is and i can be mature about that clip of michael throwing hollys woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it
41724,angela,its so cold even with my coat on
41725,meredith,maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing americans
41726,gabe,yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy
41727,holly,you guys this has to stop someone could have really gotten hurt
41728,michael,what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window you know what would have happened the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off and yes it might have been funny but it also would have been incredibly tragic
41729,dwight,i could not agree more and just want to state for the record that i am intending to sue jim for acute psychological distress
41730,jim,what are you talking about youre the one terrorizing me
41731,dwight,with snowballs jim with fluffy little snowballs no i thought we were just playing
41732,holly,dwights right what you did was dangerous and inappropriate im really surprised at you guys last time i was here you were both best friends
41733,michael,all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story you see this on my desk he holds up a toy taxi cab know who gave me this my girlfriend tara who lives in new york city
41734,dwight,wait what girlfriend
41735,michael,i havent told you about her
41736,dwight,i find that unlikely you email me when you get a new zit
41737,michael,im a man in my mids and i still get zits i think thats pretty interesting but you know what i am not on trial here the scranton strangler is so anyway we have this great weekend and she drives me to the airport and we get to jfk but i am flying out of laguardia so we laugh and laugh and laugh and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slomo drinking latte and at the end of the day she gives me this and she says michael maybe next time you should take a cab
41738,holly,i didnt know you had a girlfriend
41739,michael,i do she is
41740,michael,did you see her face well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g scott and it aint tara
41741,phyllis,so you went homemade this year
41742,pam,yup
41743,phyllis,yeah money problems is that what this is about i mean oh dear i dont think we can help you out
41744,pam,no no jim had a great year actually i just wanted to get your opinion
41745,phyllis,are you good at homemade
41746,pam,look at this
41747,phyllis,yeah
41748,holly,walks in with a dirty woody who did this its obvious to me im not welcome here but somebody better tell me who did this or else im leaving
41749,phyllis,well i dont think erin seems to like you
41750,erin,thats not true i dont know her enough to make a decision even
41751,michael,what happened what happened toby what did you do i think tobys very jealous of all the attention youve been getting
41752,toby,no i would never ever do anything like that but it does seem like something you would do
41753,michael,oh really turn it on me well isnt that nice thank you very much
41754,kevin,wait wait guys listen toy story is all about toys that come to life when people arent looking you dont think its not possible that woody did this to himself
41755,michael,it is christmas
41756,angela,no it really seems like something michael would do
41757,michael,mmhmm mmhmm well the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me and that i have been framed
41758,andy,why would anyone frame you for that
41759,jim,okay im sorry why are we discounting this whole woody came to life thing so quickly
41760,michael,ahhhhhh laughs surprise it was part of the party pretty funny huh
41761,holly,you think this is funny
41762,michael,laughs i dont but someday i think we will laugh about this when we tell our kids
41763,jim,yikes everyone gasps
41764,kevin,oh no thats thats not happening
41765,dwight,dear god in heaven
41766,michael,all right shh okay you know what holly i didnt mean to do it it was an accident an accident borne of jealous feelings
41767,holly,michael you have to let this go im with someone else i dont feel that way anymore
41768,michael,oh really you certainly seemed jealous when i told you about my fake girlfriend thats what jim and dwight thought
41769,dwight,okay hey hey hey
41770,jim,no fake girlfriends are always wrong
41771,holly,you made up a fake girlfriend to see if id get jealous and you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me what is the matter with you
41772,michael,when you got transferred and i drove you up to nashua you said michael i love you but i cant do this but then with this other guy you dont have any problem with a longdistance relationship do you and you know what that is what is the matter with me
41773,holly,michael im sorry
41774,michael,and we did this whole stupid party for you
41775,erin,blocks hollys path no
41776,holly,you guys it wasnt my fault
41777,kevin,oh nothing is ever your fault just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us
41778,erin,i really think youre better off
41779,michael,mmm erin would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me please
41780,erin,yeah is she an amazing cook or something
41781,jim,walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it reading the note hey pickles merry christmas open immediately love swiss cheese opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him everyone laughs damn it dwight
41782,dwight,didnt think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing did you jim let that be a lesson to you all
41783,stanley,so do they bring in food or do you get to go out
41784,toby,no they bring it in

41798,andy,do you know the other state
41799,darryl,maybe the grinch hid the christmas star and we could ask for clues and hell tell us if were hot or cold

44537,michael,how do you mean
44538,dwight,black bears can smell a salami at five miles michael what are you thinking and they run faster than a horse so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse i would try a cheetah you in tight pants michael are a salami to a black bear do you understand michael nods in agreement youre like a giant walking salami

45414,erin,still id really like to see this office with you in the bosss chair
45415,andy,dont even getting really happy and excited eeehhhh
45416,erin,you in the bosss chair
45417,andy,eeehhh no hehe
45418,andy,in my family you dont really go out and get things if you want something you write it on a list and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it on wednesdays and fridays so i dont know i guess you could say this job is on my list and awkwardly smiling well see what rosa comes back with
45419,erin,checks to see that she is alone with phyllis did you hear anything
45420,phyllis,oh im sure theyll let us know when they get the results erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly
45421,phyllis,it turns out that erin was born in the basic time and region that i gave away a child
45422,erin,so phyllis might be my mom i mean the chances are tiny but
45423,phyllis,but probably not i mean it was a big year for babies porkys had come out
45424,erin,yeah im sure i was just another porkys baby
45425,phyllis,mm
45426,erin,but why not find out
45427,phyllis,yeah
45428,pam,to dwight who is reading the want ads should you really be so blatant about that
45429,dwight,they wont make me manager and i wont settle for anything less ive gone about as far as i can here thats obvious time to take my talents elsewhere
45430,pam,are you really going to apply for work at scranton breadworks
45431,dwight,bread is the paper of the food industry you write your sandwich on it
45433,jim,unfortunately that range is set at corporate
45434,erin,what about mileage when i use my car i mean gas aint cheap you know
45435,jim,heh we think that  cents a mile is pretty generous
45436,erin,how about  and uh when i make longdistance calls will they be monitored or is it on the honor system
45437,angela,on phone okay hangs up smiling how odd a very unusual phone call from the senators office the senator wants me to have lunch with him at the botanical gardens
45438,kevin,the botanical gardens scrantons hidden gem dont eat any berries you dont recognize
45439,toby,how will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here
45440,robert,you dont work in sales do you
45441,toby,uh human resources
45442,robert,you see i sit across from a man i see his face i see his eyes now does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deepsea drilling equipment dont be a fool he wants respect he wants love he wants to be younger he wants to be attractive there is no such thing as a product dont ever think there is there is only sex everything is sex you understand that what im telling you is a universal truth toby
45443,toby,yes
45444,gabe,okay ii am im almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position robert and gabe chuckle at this then gabe stops chuckling do you um do you think that you are
45445,robert,do i look like someone who would waste my own time
45446,gabe,no robert then nods his head at jim
45447,jim,can you seems intimidated clears throat you are a man of great confidence could you speak a little more to that and what the role of confidence would be in a dialogue with a subordinate
45448,robert,will you be heard will you have a voice will i steamroll over you do you feel heard right now jim do you have a voice right now you can answer me
45449,jim,yes
45450,robert,that was your choice not mine the fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller it is up to the object whether it will be flattened or not and i can tell from the small interaction weve had already you wont be flattened by anybody do you agree with me jim
45451,jim,yes
45452,robert,more emphatically than jim yes you do nods at the search committee then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face
45453,jim,robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves he creeps me out toby nods but i think he might be a genius
45454,andy,jim points at darryl to be the next interviewee good luck darryl
45455,darryl,pats andy on the back thank you
45456,darryl,think about it what other mammal besides humans drinks the milk of another mammal i mean you dont see a bear drinking raccoon milk
45457,jim,jim and gabe laugh toby smiles and nods oh
45458,darryl,so this is cool i think we make a good fit stands up
45459,gabe,oh uh we havent started the interview yet were youwere you joking
45460,darryl,uh looks at camera yes i was sits back down little joke
45461,toby,so how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office
45462,darryl,i thought that was your job
45463,toby,well its one of my strengths but its the managers job
45464,jim,well for instance how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight
45465,darryl,ill answer that jim i would use it as an opportunity to teach uh about actions and consequences of actions jim and gabe stare at darryl
45466,darryl,noticing erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office whos that
45467,jim,ignoring darryls question so i think all we need is a resume and well be good right
45468,darryl,i i just thought you knew me
45469,jim,yeah its no big deal just something that looks like that shows darryl a resume cool goes to put the resume away
45470,darryl,let me jim shows him the resume again darryl looks at it a little longer this time oh cool jim gives darryl a thumbsup then looks at the camera as darryl gets up to leave
45472,robert,ohh unfortunately yes
45474,robert,that business cant attract anyone its awful up there those people seem like theyre in prison waiting out life sentences in a dying industry
45477,dwight,what makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview robert stares at dwight what are you doing dwight sits up abruptly stop trying to figure me out
45478,robert,i just did
45479,dwight,you cant
45480,robert,its done
45481,dwight,no its not
45482,robert,i know you now your nature im done not worth continuing at the same time dwight says  you dont know me anything about me get out of my head
45483,dwight,stop trying to figure me out robert turns to ignore dwight do you even know anything about paper how its made
45484,robert,i saw an episode of how they make paper on sesame street nods at dwight mockingly
45485,dwight,standing up get out
45486,dwight,im gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak passionless leadership do you see my hat no thats because i just threw it in the ring
45488,toby,well why would you need relocation if you already live in scranton
45490,jim,can i ask why youre leaving your current job
45492,jim,is this a bad time to be doing this
45494,toby,im sorry if we did something to upset you im sure it was inadvertent
45497,angela,limo driver lets angela out of the limo at the office parking lot thank you
45498,pam,looking at an engagement ring on angelas finger its gorgeous angela
45499,kelly,yeah i actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous

45505,pam,laughing ohhoho he talked about himself in the third person
45506,angela,yes pam not everyone is as informal as you and jim imitating jims voice oh hey pam dude whatever wanna marry me erin kelly and meredith laugh
45507,pam,thats not accurate
45508,angela,then i saw flashes reporters were there they always find us and everyone was crying even his aide camera pans and shows oscar in disbelief
45509,oscar,angelas engaged to a gay man as a gay man im horrified as a friend of angelas horrified as a lover of elegant weddings smiles im a little excited expression becomes serious again but overall horrified
45510,jim,andy you all set

45515,jim,so andy what improvements would you make as office manager
45516,andy,for starters i really think we can streamline communication around here gets cut off by gabe
45517,gabe,whoa thats a very heavy accusation to level against toby
45518,andy,i wasnt acc accusing
45519,gabe,well tobys in charge of human resources that would include communication i think that tobys done a fine job
45520,andy,right i really wasnt trying to insult any anyone
45521,toby,i didnt think you were

46251,andy,hi guys i just wanted to say that you all have been doing amazing work really
46252,kevin,thank you
46253,andy,and id like to add that your work has been a little sloppy so dwight and i have implemented a new program that we like to calldwight
46254,dwight,the accountability booster it registers every time a mistake has been made in the office from a late delivery to an accounting error five strikes in a day equals a home run one home run and youre out
46255,andy,if we as a group make five mistakes in a day something bad happens like we block minesweeper
46256,dwight,or in this case an email gets sent to robert california containing the consultants report from last year remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown and as a failsafe also every negative email youve ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him
46257,kelly,what emails are you talking about
46258,dwight,roberts favorite songs creep by tlc creep by radio head you remember that one jim there is no way he hasnt strangled at least one stripper oscar he eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him kelly
46259,kelly,thats not that bad actually
46260,dwight,ps we should should kill him
46261,jim,wait so you installed a doomsday device
46262,dwight,no its an accountability booster
46263,jim,which when it goes off it destroys everything very similar to a doomsday device
46264,dwight,jim youre trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other i am confident that you guys are equal to the task
46265,kelly,um no were not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives
46266,ryan,we cant do this dwight
46267,dwight,everyone angrily disagreeingsmilenod smile and nod
46268,dwight,they are making me out to be a bond villian i like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world likenot doctor moreau someone good doctor frankenstein doctor jekyll not them doctor
46269,andy,are you sure this is a good idea i mean the thing about this office is we make a lot of mistakes
46270,dwight,but the device will change that without a safety net people will improve
46271,andy,alright everybody looks like we need to be getting to work be extra careful double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha
46272,stanley,this doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me
46273,oscar,theres an easy way to tell if this device is a sham we just make a mistake ill send an order down to shipping before weve received payment
46274,dwight,alert goes off oh theres one mistake
46275,erin,now we only have four strikes left until a home run
46276,andy,dwights our coworker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so i
46277,dwight,its not a doomsday device gosh erin makes red strike on desk we can do this you guys
46279,darryl,its not a race
46281,darryl,who knows what the belt is for
46282,gabe,its for protecting my ass when you suckers lift more than you can handle sup im gabe corporate continue dont be nervous

46287,gabe,i get the sense that val enjoys a good putdown considering thats the only thing i know about her i will be milking that hard gestures milking a cow
46288,gabe,its like a hula hoop right mele kalikimaka is the wise way
46289,darryl,you done
46290,gabe,the michelin man called he wants his cummerbund back

46296,angela,oscar use a calculator oscar shakes head

46613,erin,oh dpa sounds way more important that total deaths
46614,dwight,oh it is and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home i mean it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush laughs im telling you theyre heartbreaking too so beautifully written
46615,oscar,dwight what are you telling this girl

46644,robert,that was bad
46645,stanley,if your woman is like mine i bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time this paper is so hard it scratches why cant there be a paper just for me well now there is papyr paper for women its pink scented and silky soft now you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister
46646,robert,the situation you described returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine is not one im familiar with
46647,stanley,in the africanamerican community
46648,robert,no
46649,stanley,murmurs thought it was worth a try
46650,darryl,thats fascinating tell me whats the significance of the peach orchard thought
46652,dwight,excuse me i got a question for you

46667,robert,i am not
46668,pam,um excuse me im gonna go to the bathroom
46669,pam,at this point when youre this pregnant its kind of like senior spring the other day i spit my gum out on the carpet
46670,robert,kevin youve been quiet im curious to know what your gamechanger is
46671,kevin,well you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the a spot they do that cause they think as the best spot for the best cookie but the real best spot is d right thats where the eyes go so
46672,robert,cookies cookie placement
46673,kevin,yeah but not just the cookies though that was just a for instance
46674,robert,who else agrees with kevin that were wasting facilities manpower on our underselling products when we should be pushing our topperformers everyone raises their hand robert laughs there you go consensus
46675,ryan,okay we are now on a planet where kevin is the most creative person around and i am just some goodlooking guy
46676,gabe,as lincoln i just dont understand its  victory is ours ive saved the very soul of our nation and yet happiness eludes me oh perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits
46678,kevin,kay so another thing about oatmeal cookies who even wants them i mean ive seen toby eat one like once but other than that scoffs like forget it
46679,robert,interesting so what is dunder mifflins oatmeal cookie what is the product that no one wants

46706,dwight,really
46707,oscar,yeah
46708,dwight,well  anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms

46728,robert,well what is the idea
46729,kevin,every time you buy a big mac you set one ingredient aside  then at the end of the week you have a free big mac  and you love it even more because you made it with your own hands
46730,ryan,you know what  now i remember  that was your idea patting kevin on the back that is  percent your idea

48276,oscar,when the team left for tallahassee dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure cut to dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office dont touch my treasure ok you understand obviously he wants us to obsess about it theres nothing in there has realization which is obviously what he would want us to think making it the perfect place to hide a treasure oh god im wallace shawn in the princess bride
48277,andy,i think that dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure everyone disagrees
48278,oscar,i am dying to know whats in there

48920,andy,this is what i was trying to tell you
48921,robert,im not accustomed to people saying no to me laughs
48922,nellie,well bobby get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes
48923,robert,youre both adults im sure you can figure this out between yourselves
48924,robert,i never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision so i find it best to excuse myself temporarily until ive had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally buffett operates the same way
48925,nellie,im gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office im going to dock your pay one hundred dollars
48926,andy,chuckling okay

48942,erin,when i see him start to get mad i just put my hand on his arm like this
48943,nellie,i know what lets go ten thousand dollars andy laughs five four
48944,andy,youre just saying numbers its meaningless

48948,erin,there you go helps andy in the car hey were gonna have a nice hot date
48949,erin,hey so last night was so not a big deal
48950,andy,oh yeah i was just tired
48951,erin,we both were plus i was definitely not my normal sexy self
48952,andy,whoa no are you kidding you were so sexy just the thought of you last night like crazy turns me on it just didnt last night
48953,erin,really its not a big deal
48954,andy,yeah i know its not a big deal
48955,ryan,i found this the other day while i was journaling and they reminded me of you
48956,kelly,oh those are from our weekend at the time share
48957,ryan,yeah the fractional ownership property sigh oh we took this one right before we got in that huge fight
48958,kelly,god i dont even remember what that fight was about
48959,ryan,you were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner but all i remember is how pretty you looked taking those pictures of me anyway if you want to order prints of your own i can send you the link
48960,ryan,im in love with kelly kapoor and i dont know how im gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that but i do know that right here right now all i can think about is spending the rest of my life with her again that could change
48961,erin,when you lost the manager job
48962,dwight,yes
48963,erin,did it affect you outside of the office
48964,dwight,how
48965,erin,i dont know what the technical term is penial softiosis
48966,dwight,erin i am so glad that you trusted me you came to the exact right person for this no i have never once experienced anything remotely like that never
48967,erin,oh okay
48968,dwight,okay
48969,erin,okay
48970,dwight,washington monument
48971,erin,oh

48975,kelly,hes so sweet he pointed to my latte and he said kelly that will be the color of our children
48976,pam,yeah hes so great remember how it felt when he cheated on you though
48977,kelly,which time
48978,pam,i am not going to let kelly throw her life away on ryan and it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician why you would even ask or were going to ask because i i felt like that question was coming
48979,dwight,one of tobys eyes is getting smaller so theres that gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and meredith said she was interested and then gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket so ill keep you posted on that
48980,dwight,every day i brief nellie on whats going on in the office most of its irrelevant but a good informer doesnt judge whats worth passing on
48981,dwight,oh and andy lost his masculinity so congratulations on that
48982,nellie,what do you mean
48983,dwight,erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night by contrast i went to sleep with an erection so large it was like i was wearing no blanket at all wow i knew youd win but you just demolished him im a little bit jealous actually reduced him to a mere ant
48984,nellie,i just wanted to take the mans job not his manhood
48985,nellie,okay i would like to invite everyone into the conference room
48986,andy,you cant call a meeting laughs but i would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now so lets get in the conference room thank you good thank you for coming to my meeting
48987,nellie,okay if you would like to take a seat we can get started
48988,andy,oh cant do it cause i gotta run a meeting so
48989,nellie,no
48990,andy,wanted to talk to all of you guys about reads whiteboard importance and know that each and every one of you is vitally important
48991,robert,andrew not everyone here is important and the word is impotence
48992,nellie,which is important in its own way so if youd just like to take a seat andy
48993,nellie,take a mans job but leave him his balls margaret thatcher said that probably dont know dont read didnt see the movie
48994,nellie,this meeting is not about any one person in particular it is a human problem
48995,dwight,its not just a human problem flounders frequently experience impotence especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male
48996,oscar,nellie does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular
48997,nellie,oh oh its not me no no ive never had any problem in that arena and i have been with several older men

49036,gabe,ive read and i dont know anything about this personally but they say prostate stimulation can help
49037,angela,ugh
49038,gabe,this is just uh this american life i think i heard it on
49039,robert,no thats absolutely the case
49040,gabe,i know right
49041,dwight,you know my rectal electroejaculator is rated for bovine use only but i could let you rent it
49042,robert,andy why dont you tell us about the best erection of your life or does anyone else have any remarkable erections theyd like to share creed kevin and meredith raise their hands
49043,kevin,ooh ooh
49044,jim,wow what are we talking about
49045,erin,toby doesnt hr have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff
49046,toby,erin hr is a joke i cant do anything about anything
49047,nellie,the most important thing to remember is not to stress about this stress just makes it worse and then you stress more and thats a vicious spiral
49048,robert,i almost didnt come in today laughs
49049,andy,on the phone dad dont think of it as a demotion just think of it as a promotion to a lower level i dont think you have to tell your friends anything it hasnt been decided yet
49050,nellie,erin on phone memos youre writing the date american style month day year i prefer it day month year small bigger biggest oh sexual innuendo not intentional
49051,erin,shut up shut up i am sick of your dumb opinions and if you dont like the way that i take phone messages here throws phone take em yourself
49052,andy,oh and another thing our sex life is none of your businesses
49053,erin,and andy is the manager not nellie
49054,andy,stop protecting me im a man i can protect myself this is misdirected anger and im sorry i dont mean to lash out at you theres a lot coming up right now all at once into phone dad go to hell im taller than you
49055,nellie,okay just calm down
49056,andy,you are not the manager i earned that job i was personally chosen after robert was chosen and quit
49057,robert,andy why dont you just take a seat
49058,andy,why dont you take a seat you idiot throws chair
49059,erin,and why dont you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels
49060,andy,and your stupid face grabs nellies photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground and your stupid office punches hole in the wall ah
49061,darryl,he does not like that wall
49062,erin,maybe well get sent to anger management together

50123,nellie,will you join me then in a pledge to live by taliban law in this office offers dwight a contract
50124,dwight,takes contract absolutely i will
50125,dwight,i feared nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font huh in a fake english accent you dont have a plan
50126,nellie,when you use a ridiculous font no one thinks you have a plan
50127,nellie,holds up pen as dwight searches his desk looking for this
50128,dwight,what the follows nellie into the break room

50130,dwight,taking pen back gimme that
50131,nellie,didnt you sign a contract to live under taliban law and now theres been theft that means youre not serious or someones getting their hand cut off
50132,dwight,youre insane
50133,nellie,i know so its better that you pick another charity
50134,dwight,oh and let your precious operation power grab proceed unchecked no thank you
50135,nellie,in that case you pulls out a cleaver will have to chop off my hand
50136,dwight,considers then takes cleaver this cleaver appears to need sharpening i suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand tie a shoe toss a salad do any of the two hand activities that youll miss the most
50137,nellie,i tell you what i need to make three calls and then after that you can become a person who chops off peoples hands
50138,dwight,sounds like a plan
50139,andy,in his office clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment
50140,erin,yeah
50141,andy,entering annex clark you and i need to have a little chat what clothes does erin need for this news audition

51346,nellie,well this is getting us nowhere
51347,pam,we need another approach um we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group they notice nate struggling with a box yeah i think if we could get nate alone we could crack him

51349,pam,see i feel bad about that
