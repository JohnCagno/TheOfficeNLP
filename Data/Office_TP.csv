dwight,im sorry it makes me nervous
documentary crew member,understood but it is what we need to capture what youre saying as clearly as possible
dwight,i understand its in a blind spot because im trained in several martial arts and one of them uh includes uh an awareness that the masters bring uh of anything on all sides of you it could be behind you or whatever this is directly in a blind spot so im trained to respond negatively to something right above my head new take this now i have an eye on you see its on my periphery and if i needed to block it attack it stop it somehow does a martial arts move with his hands i could come right out i mean i know youre doing your job but documentary crew member talking over dwight its

mr brown,thank you thank you thank you great
michael,come on people lets get em in get in the cards get in the cards
mr brown,thank you thank you very much ok thanks for filling these out and i promise thisll be quick at diversity today our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations we believe that 99 of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance
michael,you know what this is a colorfreezone here stanley i dont look at you as another race
mr brown,uh see this is what im talking about we dont have to pretend were colorblind
michael,exactly were not
mr brown,thats fighting ignorance with more ignorance
michael,with tolerance
mr brown,no with more ignorance
michael,ignorance
mr brown,right exactly uh instead we need to celebrate our diversity
michael,lets celebrate
mr brown,right ok
michael,celebrate good times come on lets celebrate diversity right
mr brown,yes exactly now heres what were going to do ive noticed that
michael,you know what heres what were going to do why dont we go around and everybody everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually i will go last go
dwight,i have two white and indian
mr brown,actually id prefer not to start that way michael i would love to have your permission to run this session can i have your permission
michael,yes
mr brown,thank you very much and it would also help me if you were seated
michael,ok
mr brown,thank you ok now at the start of the session i had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace now what im going to do is choose one and were going to act it out
dwight,a few of the ground rules
michael,hey hey why dont you run it by me and ill run it by him
dwight,ok can we steer away from gay people
mr brown,um
dwight,im sorry its an orientation its not a race plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays soparadox
mr brown,well we only have an hour
dwight,i figured it would save time
michael,ok why dont we just defer to mr
mr brown,mr brown
michael,ah oh right ok first test i will not call you that
mr brown,well its my name its not a test ok um so looking through the cards ive noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident which is ironic because its the exact incident i was brought in here to respond to now how many of you are familiar with the chris rock routine very good ok
michael,how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and groundbreaking and then i go and do the exact same routine same comedic timing and people file a complaint to corporate is it because im white and chris is black
mr brown,so were going to reenact this with a more positive outcome
michael,i will play the chris rock guy i would like to see someone else pull this off
mr brown,well lets have someone who wasnt involved in the reenactment
michael,ok i will play guy listening
mr brown,great guy listening ok anyone else remember
kevin,i remember
mr brown,great youre the chris rock guy and youre guy listening
michael,ok
michael,kevin is a great guy hes a great accountant he is not much of an entertainer
kevin,basically there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people every time the one type wants to have a good time then the other type comes in and makes a real mess
michael,ok im sorry im sorry hes ruin hes butchering it could you just let me as chris rock every time every time black people want to have a good time some ignant ass bleep i take care of my kid
mr brown,wait a second
michael,bleep they always want credit for something they supposed to do
mr brown,stop it
michael,as chris rock what you want a cookie
mr brown,now this is a simple acronym hero uh at diversity today we believe it is very easy to be a hero all you need are honesty empathy respect and openmindedness
dwight,excuse me im sorry but thats not all it takes to be a hero
mr brown,oh great well what is a hero to you
dwight,a hero kills people people that wish him harm
mr brown,ok
dwight,a hero is parthuman and partsupernatural a hero is born out of a childhood trauma or out of a disaster that must be avenged
mr brown,ok youre thinking of a superhero
dwight,we all have a hero in our heart
mr brown,now i need you to take these forms this kind of expresses the joint experience we had today and i need you to look em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge
michael,clears throat i dont think i can sign this
mr brown,i cant leave until you do
michael,well ok it says here that i learned something and i knew all this stuff already so i know i could sign something that says that i taught something or that i helped you teach something so pam where is she pam could we change something on this
mr brown,michael can i talk to you candidly
michael,sure
mr brown,we both know that im here because of the comments you made
michael,heres the thing this office i think this is very advanced in terms of racial awareness and its probably more advanced than youre used to thats probably throwing you off a little bit
mr brown,um its not throwing me i need your signature
michael,ok well i know you told me that several times
mr brown,yes but youre not listening to me yours is the only signature i need
michael,ok
mr brown,those are my instructions from the corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made the reason i made copies for everyone was so you wouldnt be embarrassed
michael,well here i am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training and you dont
mr brown,dont worry about dating
michael,i wont
mr brown,ok thank you
michael,yeah yeah
michael,i regret my actions i regret offending my coworkers i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty empathy respect and openmindedness openmindedness is that even a word into the workplace in this way i can truly be a hero signed daffy duck laughing hes going to lose it when he reads that
jim,yeah hi is mr decker around oh well could you just have him call me after lunch thank you
michael,i pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart i do believe in that part of the pledge i that just read but a pledge come on i mean who are we the girl scouts no look the guy mr brown he got us halfway there he got us talking well no i got us talking he got us nothing he insulted us and he abandoned us you call that diversity training i dont were there any connections between any of us did anyone look each other in the eye was there any emotion going on no where was the heart i didnt see any heart where was my oprah moment ok get as much done as you can before lunch because afterward im going to have you all in tears

mr brown,hero at diversity today we believe it is very easy to be a hero all you need are honesty empathy respect and openmindedness
michael,i just think that hero its cute but its its empty you know its easy dwight you know what i came up with some terms of my own could you put these on the board the first one is inclusion new attitudes colorblind
mr brown,oh nice
michael,expectations
mr brown,good
michael,thank you sharing
mr brown,great
michael,and tolerance
mr brown,beautiful
pam,um that spells incest
mr brown,oh my sorry that is not appropriate
michael,well its not ideal but you have to give me some credit cause i made it into a word
mr brown,yeah but its not appropriate this is not helpful as a memory aid
michael,i will give you a number of reasons why it is actually okay first incest is bad racism is bad no brainer right two incest were all a family right were all brothers and sisters racial message um number three and this is a fact the states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest okay and finally
mr brown,okay michael i just
michael,no no no no wait final one final one this is important the more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest literally
pam,it wouldve been just as easy for him to spell insect of course that wouldnt have made any sense either
mr brown,does anyone have anything else at all anyone besides michael
ryan,i have something
mr brown,yes please
ryan,um well i grew up here in scranton and when i was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated and he had the most incredible stories about

michael,yeah but no seriously uh you know hes not a member of the full staff so uh ryan you wanna just step outside
ryan,what do you want me to do
michael,well maybe you should go down to the parking lot you know what yes go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots cool cause the handicaps get a raw deal oh you know what that ties right into new attitudes new attitudes about handicap people very important

michael,ive really learned from the greats the great improvisers drew carey ryan stiles uh the brady guy not so much hes more the signing wayne brady um robin williams oh man would i love to go headtohead with him oh that would be exciting as robin williams hi im mork from ork well im bork from spork nanoo nanoo jibelee baloobaloo as robin williams thats good morning vietnam well hello to you you know it would be god and you know what sometimes when im watching somebody like um like jay leno hell be half way through his step snaps his fingers and i will already be laughing at the punch line he hasnt even gotten to it he doesnt even know what it is it so its fun you know its fun having a mind that works like that that is just a few steps ahead of comedically ahead of like whats going on like ill watch tv and ill be watching a show and i will think oh i know someones gonna walk in here right now and say something funny and then they do or um i know theyll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down theres going to be some sort of insult and there is you know theres like oh youre god your butt is fat and i knew it i know its like i knew they were going to say that i knew they were gonna go there dont go there um but other you know its like uh you know leno um and letterman carson you know need i say more no
dwight,oh um jan wants you to call her
michael,were all going bowling
dwight,michael
michael,oh god dwight come on
dwight,i wanted to talk to you about the downsizing
michael,theres no downsizing
dwight,i but if there were id be protected as assistant regional manager
michael,assistant to the regional manager dwight
dwight,yeah so i dont have to worry
michael,look look look i talked to corporate about protecting the sales staff and they said they couldnt guarantee it if theres downsizing okay
michael,but theres no downsizing so just dont
dwight,bottom line do i need to be worried
michael,mmm mm mm maybe
michael,it looks like theres gonna be downsizing and its part of my job but blah i hate it i think the main difference between me and donald trump is that uh i get no pleasure out of saying the words youre fired as donald trump youre foired uh youre foired it just makes people sad and an office cant function that way no way as donald trump youre foired  i think if i had a catchphrase it would be youre hired and you can work here as long as you want but thats unrealistic so
dwight,its a real shame cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through watercooler gossip than through official memos which puts me at a disadvantage because i bring my own water to work
stanley,whyd you do this
dwight,i didnt do it what do you mean oh the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance so what do you guys hear whats the scuttlebutt
michael,get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott now i think i have had a little stroke of genius in that i have had my assistant pam smile pam i have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it not bad not bad at all all right and the birthday person is drum roll please here we go who is the birthday birthday person

jim,and i spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him but only in ways that could get me arrested and then here he comes and he says no jim heres a way
dwight,theres one other thing and this is important lets keep this alliance totally a secret dont tell anyone

michael,tmi too much information i used to say dont go there but that is so lame now or you go girl or um when did wheres the beef that was like a long long time ago its funny how the shelf life of these things like how long they last like too much information probably came on the scene i mean i didnt hear it till like this month so its pretty recently um but you know theyre generally good for like no more than five or six years
toby,yes thats true i have never won a dundie i am more than okay  with that
kelly,i think im gonna share some cadillac fajitas with toby toby is so cute except he has that stupid kid
angela,yes im the designated driver which is very important we need everyone to get home safely sighs but no one ever gives me gas money and people live all over its expensive
dwight,scoffs like a gaggle of geese jibbering mockingly
michael,all right we need something for kevin
jim,mmmhmmm
michael,what do we know about him hes an accountant
jim,he plays guitar he likes naval history hes a bowler
michael,talking over jim hes fat the fat accountant award
jim,well you seem to have this under control
jim,the weird part about this whole deal this that michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational i mean he puts more effort and time and commitment into the dundies than anything else he does all year which is probably why this branch will be downsized
michael,i am the fat accountant
dwight,michael i need to talk to you
michael,here he is
dwight,i just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies room wall
michael,really what did they say for a good time call michael scott
jim,good one
dwight,uh no no no i think something bad maybe
michael,why do you think that you just immediately go to that dwight why are you so negative why
dwight,michael
michael,i mean you just come in and youre just negative
dwight,michael
michael,and you just walk negatively
michael,do you want me to find out what it says
michael,yes
dwight,by any means necessary
michael,what does that even mean what are you what are you talking about
dwight,its the ladies room
michael,just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me but dont tell anybody that i have anything to do with it because if they ask me i will say that you are crazy
michael,thank you you wont regret this michael
jim,what award would you like to give dwight
michael,i hadnt planned on including him
jim,okay
michael,kevin
dwight,it hasnt always been easy being a whistleblower when i was in school the kids would call me a tattletale or a snitch or a worm so i really identify with those women from enron i wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me but they never wrote back i guess theyre all married
dwight,angela its simple just tell me what the bathroom wall says
angela,i dont talk about what goes on in the restroom
dwight,im not asking what you do in there i just want to know whats written about michael
angela,i dont says those kinds of things out loud its inappropriate
dwight,okay ill talk you nod if i get it right does it have to do with his butt or his wiener
kevin,i think his characters are pretty funny especially ping
michael,well what should i do guys seriously do you want me to just cancel the dundies
kelly,no we were just hoping you wouldnt do those characters like last time
michael,ping everybody loves ping hes my most popular character
oscar,i think many people find that character slightly racist
michael,really well he is based on the chinese delivery guy that i have who talks exactly like that so i think you should take it up with him instead of me
oscar,look im just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits
michael,sighs well neither of you are chinese so what why do you care
phyllis,dwight get out of here
dwight,no no no

phyllis,thats what i said he was spying in the ladies room
dwight,what do you think phyllis you think i followed you in there like oh good phyllis is going to the bathroom so maybe i get to see her naked from the waist down im not even attracted to you

phyllis,when
michael,oh i dont know maybe after i finish writing producing directing and hosting your awards show all right just relax keep your pants on unless of course youre in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without creepsville central spying on you good

michael,toby is in hr which technically means he works for corporate so hes really not a part of our family also hes divorced so hes really not a part of his family
toby,the full story is that randall resigned because of sexual harassment so corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the company sexual harassment policy
michael,no no toby no
toby,its really not a big deal michael
michael,it is a big deal its a big deal what are we supposed to do scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day i mean come on
toby,and then corporate is going to send in a lawyer
michael,what
toby,just to refresh you
michael,no
toby,on our policy
michael,what he no okay what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us to not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes
toby,maybe not some of them maybe not inappropriate ones
michael,there is no such thing as an appropriate joke thats why its a joke
michael,everyone hello everyone hi sorry to interrupt i know youre all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption but toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day to toby so take it away
toby,yeah okay corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the company sexual harassment policy so ill go over that later
michael,i wish you luck toby i really do but you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and i just cant wait to see how you handle it
michael,a guy goes to a five dollar lady of the night and he gets crabs so the next day he goes back to complain and the woman says hey it was only five dollars what did you expect lobster this is whats at stake
michael,time to bring out the big guns im heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born find a killer joke thatll just blow everybody away at the seminar later and remind them what is great about this place so ah here they are to warehouse guys guys wondering if i could uh get your help for something im looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer and it does not need to be clean so whatcha got
darryl,like a joke a knockknock joke
michael,um yeah no well i mean better better than that the type of stuff you guys tell all day
darryl,well points at michael those are some awful tight pants you have on whered you get em like queers r us

toby,arent the suggestions meant for you
michael,well toby if by me you are inferring that i have bo then i would say that is a very poor choice of words
creed,uh michael he wasnt inferring he was implying  you were inferring
michael,was i creed  ok well you know what i am implying is that when were on an elevator together i should maybe take the stairs because talk about stank  not that i would ever say something like that in public and i never have and i never will i just think its something that we should all be aware of  ok  now that weve learned this lets continue  see this is good were learning and were figuring some stuff out  you need to do something about your coffee breath
dwight,you need

dwight,you liked it
michael,oh did not
dwight,jan have you ever had deer

ryan,actually i had mine already

michael,yeah that gould is a real interesting guy a gem i can see why he and jan are no longer together if my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship he was verbally abusive he was curt he was he had an inability to communicate shall i say he was emotionally unavailable i dont know how she dealt with that as long as she did
michael,never
jan,never for me always means never ever ever

michael,well you kept
marybeth,he kept saying shut up
michael,going into nuclear something thats not where the scene was going
marybeth,i
billy,it goes wherever
michael,well it goes it goes in the best direction and that was not the best direction
marybeth,i felt like he was ordering me around cause he
michael,well he michael scarn that character orders people around and thats you should of just gone
improv teacher,all your characters order people around though and
michael,well
improv teacher,theres stronger choices
michael,i dont think theres any stronger choice than being a really strong character
marybeth,weve seen you do that character before though  i mean you know thats cool
michael,well its like well its you know when refine it refine a character down to its essence  thats
marybeth,like jim carrey or something
michael,exactly thank you
marybeth,right well i wasnt saying that
michael,i appreciate that
marybeth,nah i know i just meant that he shot me i just
michael,or ryan stiles something like that
marybeth,yeah ya know maybe he made me get on the ground and i didnt feel safe in this game
michael,you shouldnt have been cause you were dealing with michael scarn  that was exactly what i was hoping to achieve so that is probably the best thing you could have said thats a compliment
improv teacher,you succeeded
michael,good work
marybeth,yeah
jim,and in this room here if you look closely you will find out a few clues about who lives here  um he likes biking obviously and uh what else  uh he likes tour guides i guess  and if youre very perceptive youll notice that he didnt do a great job of cleaning his room kicks water bottle under bed  ok and uh thats the tou
ryan,and hes really into penguins or something
jim,um thank you ryan uh i dont know i think i made the mistake one day of telling someone that i like penguins and here we are
phyllis,oh im sorry  i gave you a penguin
jim,and thats why its on my desk phyllis it means a lot to me and now that i know it was from you it means even more  moving on  uh ok so thats the end of the tour for now and if you liked it please tell your friends whenever youre in scranton visit casa de la halpert

kevin,but what are we going to do with this hacked off part
michael,well that is a perfectly good minitree kevin and we are going to sell that to charity thats what christmas is all about
jim,so this year for the first time ever i got pam in secret santa and i got her this teapot which i know she really wants so she can make tea at her desk but im also going to stuff it with some inside jokes like this is my high school yearbook photo she saw it at the party and it really makes her laugh not sure why what else  ooh this is a hot sauce packet she put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup and it was really funny so i kept the other two holds up a miniature pencil this would take a little too long to explain so i wont and this is the card because christmas is the time to tell people how you feel
angela,is there anything were missing phyllis you got the lights
phyllis,yes i got those cute little ones angela looks at her disapprovingly do you think i should have gotten the big ones
angela,well see
ryan,angela drafted me into the party planning committee her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster which to me seems excessive
michael,comes into the conference room in a santa hat and beard  merry christmas ho ho ho points to ryan pimp im kidding what do we got what do we got how many plates are we getting
angela,fifty
michael,double it double everything double ice cream double napkins double it on me
michael,it was a tough year i had to fire somebody this year this party has to really rock check it out christmas bonus 3000 gs i got this for helping save the company money so i guess some good came out of firing devon after all maybe i should call him and tell him that
michael,i want people to cut loose i want people making out in closets i want people hanging from the ceilings lamp shades on the heads i want it to be a playboy mansion party and also i want you to spread the word that i will have my digital camera and ill be taking pictures all along the way and the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter incentive
pam,you do realize that we cant serve liquor at the party
michael,yeah i know damn it stupid corporate wet blankets like booze ever killed anybody
kevin  oscar,one two three they lift and start to move a desk
dwight,you guys should use a hand truck
kevin,do we have one

dwight,michael i would like to be the elf
michael,that makes sense because he has elfish features
dwight,now wearing an elf hat and ears okay everybody listen up it is time to get your presents wrap them and place them under the tree like so if you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from secret santa all right no exceptions except michael
toby,i got angela she is into these posters of babies dressed as adults i got her one of those i felt kind of weird buying that
oscar,i got creed and to tell you the truth i dont know anything about creed i know his names creed i know he works right over there i think hes irish and i  i got him this shamrock keychain

phyllis,im sorry everybody
pam,i think the tree looks nice
dwight,hey i could get some flares from my car
michael,no no shake it off everybody just lets do secret santa
michael,presents are the best way to show someone how much you care its like this tangible thing that you can point to and say hey man i love you this many dollars worth
dwight,first present oscar
oscar,rips off the wrapping shower radio neat
kelly,oh good that was from me
oscar,thanks kelly you know i was gonna get one of
dwight,okay okay thats enough lets keep it moving on jim
jim,oh cool opens his plastic bag

jim,great where did you get it
creed,i dont know it was so long ago
jim,he obviously forgot to get me something and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number holds up waytooshort sleeves and then threw it in a bag
creed,yep thats exactly what happened
dwight,pam
pam,opens up her present oh my god thank you very much santa whoever you are its awesome
jim,theres a little more to it
dwight,all right next ryan tosses present
michael,no dont
ryan,unwraps present whoa a video ipod

michael,you dont know that
ryan,yeah you left the price tag on
michael,i did
ryan,yeah
michael,what oh shoot wow okay well who cares it doesnt matter what i spent what matters is that christmas is fun right
dwight,michael
michael,oh hey for me what is in here opens a handmade oven mitt oh come on
phyllis,i knitted it for you
michael,an oven mitt okay walks out
michael,so phyllis is basically saying hey michael i know you did a lot to help the office this year but i only care about you a homemade oven mitts worth i gave ryan an ipod
kevin,should we just keep opening up the presents
dwight,we dont do anything until michael gives us further instructions
michael,i got it we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap
jim,what is yankee swap
michael,one person chooses a gift the next person can either choose a gift or steal that persons gift if your gift gets stolen then you can steal somebody elses gift or choose a new gift
jim,i thought that was called nasty christmas
pam,yeah we call it white elephant
michael,well i call it fun
oscar,why are we doing this
michael,because its better because its more special
angela,it sounds mean
michael,shut it no its not okay just give it a shot
angela,michael should have asked the party planning committee first hes not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere starts to cry
michael,okay meredith is up first heres the deal you can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody elses gift that theyve already gotten like the oven mitt
meredith,ill take the teapot
jim,oh shouldnt we  i bought that specifically for pam
michael,yankee swap thats what makes it fun pam you can steal the oven mitt now
pam,ill take the ipod
ryan,and i have to give it to her i dont have a choice
dwight,yes now you can steal the oven mitt the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift
stanley,after ryan opens a new gift  a nameplate saying kelly that was meant for kelly
ryan,yeah i figured
michael,i think this is going great
kelly,unwrapping the poster yikes
toby,well its for angela so
kelly,thats like the creepiest thing that ive ever seen
dwight,angela youre up
angela,ill take the poster some people like these
kelly,i will steal the ipod
michael,everyone wants the ipod its a huge hit it is almost a christmas miracle
michael,oh well oscar you little gourmand you have the next turn
oscar,ill take the  teapot
meredith,damn it
dwight,okay moving along meredith lets go
meredith,i really want the ipod
dwight,its already been stolen this round pick something else
michael,holding oven mitt i hope nobody takes this baby cause this is great wow look at that fine craftsmanship somebody really put a lot of work into that its beautiful
meredith,ill take the oven mitt
michael,sucker see i wanted somebody to take it boom reverse psychology
michael,reverse psychology is an awesome tool i dont know if you guys know about it but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid works like a charm
michael,opens present in addition to these paintball pellets your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute
dwight,you and me michael yes
michael,who wants to take paintball lessons how is that better than an ipod
dwight,i never said it was better than an ipod
dwight,michael keeps bragging about his ipod but you know what two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as i am is worth easily like 2 grand
dwight,shooting paintball gun at target take that saddam
michael,last gift kevin
kevin,i want the foot bath
kevin,thats the thing i bought myself im really psyched to use it pauses maybe i should have taken the ipod oh shoot
dwight,pam steal something or pick the final gift
pam,i want the ipod
kelly,damn it
jim,sure you dont want the teapot
pam,well i mean its an ipod but
jim,right
pam,sorry i
jim,no no definitely its
kelly,okay well i guess i will take that book of short stories
dwight,yes there you go i want the teapot gracias
jim,got to be kidding me
dwight,yankee swap is like machiavelli meets  christmas
michael,after phyllis leaves suddenly what is she so upset about
pam,maybe because you hated her present so much
michael,come on i think that yankee swap was a big hit i think its a success and im the one who ended up with dwights stupid paintball pellets
jim,yeah but michael the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people
stanley,and you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else
michael,well i didnt i got a big bonus because i fired devon and i used the money to buy something awesome sue me
oscar,you got a bonus check
pam,how much
michael,it wasnt it wasnt that much it was $3000

jan,great uhhuh
kelly,i want an suv with three rows of seats

phyllis,and a big walkin closet
meredith,oh thats part of my dream too
kelly,oh me too
jan,great great and pam what about you what is your dream
pam,well i always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs plant flowers on it stuff like that since i was a girl um more seriously though a husband that i love roy and i love to draw and i i did a little in college and id still love to do something where i could work with art or graphic design in some way
phyllis,shes real good
pam,thanks
jan,you know the company is offering a design training program in new york
pam,well i have a job right now so i cant really take time off
jan,well its only on weekends and then a few weeks in new york but im sure that i could ask corporate to help you out
pam,well its just that the weekends arent good because um
jan,there are always a million reasons not to do something
michael,lets start with the warehouse what bothers you as guys you know
darryl,my priority is safety
michael,ok
darryl,so it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift playing with it like a toy it kind of gets under my skin
michael,ok yeah yeah yeah shhh
darryl,uh uh uh dont shush me
michael,i that was just
darryl,that bothers me too
michael,i was breathing
roy,pam shushes me it drives me crazy
michael,i hate shushing you know thats the thing what the ok what is our beef as human men
lonny,you know thats a good question hasselhoff what bugs us
michael,ok alright good guys ragging on each other thats what guys do and we love it
jan,all right lets talk about clothing
phyllis,im excited about today whispers i love girl talk
jan,dress for the job you want not the job you have all right you can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be
angela,im not gaining anything from this seminar im a professional woman the head of accounting im in the healthiest relationship of my life i just think its insulting that jan thinks we need this and apparently judging from her outfit jan aspires to be a whore
roy,i hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then theyre like when are we going to go on a datedate
guy,i hate that too general clapping and agreement
darryl,i hate that too
kevin,that sucks so much
guy,it totally sucks
dwight,yeah and then they make you drive them to church the next morning like gas aint free
lonny,yeah on our salaries man what do they expect you know to take us out every weekend you know what i mean were not millionaires
michael,i feel you
darryl,no you dont you dont feel us how can you you know what
dwight,not literally
darryl,you say were the same but we get compensated very differently
michael,yes
darryl,we work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
michael,ah you do so
darryl,but we get paid a lot less
dwight,word
roy,like next to no benefits
michael,i know god what is that
roy,exactly
michael,it blows it blows man gah
darryl,you know this would not happen if we had a union
roy,thats what im talking about
michael,no whoa whoa yeah
roy,absolutely
darryl,thats what we need
guy,you know youre right
darryl,man see thats what ive been sayin man we need to do this finally
michael,you know what is that necessary because you already sorta have a union of guys
darryl,its more than necessary mike we need this roy you still have that card from the dockworkers union
roy,in my truck
michael,dockworkers
darryl,man hook you up
jan,generalized clapping
guy,come on man
michael,yeah you know what i think the problem is the chicks
darryl,union union yeah
michael,the problem is the chicks and you gotta blame them
darryl,are you with us mike
michael,yeahes
darryl,welcome to the warehouse
group chant,michael michael michael mi
jan,another issue is inequality of pay between men and women im sure that all of you have felt that before
michael,knocks this is important ladies take a breather jan i uh wanna can i help you um i wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union and they have some good points
jan,what a union what
michael,dont get hysterical
jan,im not
michael,part of my job is knowing how to talk to women
michael,lets be rational here what are the pros what are the cons
jan,the cons are that everyone will lose their job michael everyone office warehouse what do you think the pros are here
michael,dont talk to me that way please just theyre going to want to hear this from you
jan,you got yourself into this michael so you get yourself out
michael,but were bonding down there
jan,thats too bad
michael,i mean i just dont want to have to tell them something theyre not going to want to hear
jan,i dont want to
michael,ok come on jan after all weve been through
jan,michael michael michael
michael,we have a history
jan,michael
michael,between us
jan,dont say another word
michael,i wont
jan,get yourself down stairs
michael,im just saying we have something ok whatever
ryan,you know what we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line
stanley,this here is a runouttheclock situation just like upstairs
jan,sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office now i know this might sound silly but a  many women ask to go over it so fumble means
phyllis,mistake
meredith,slip
jan,right par for the course is a golf term it means right on track below par means worse wait that should mean better that doesnt make sense
kelly,what about second base like if michael said that he got to second base with you does that mean you like closed a deal
jan,excuse me
kelly,i mean thats a baseball term right
jan,i dont know what michael was talking about i dont know
kelly,in the background and you went to chilis and he got to second base with you
jan,in the background kelly i dont know what michaels talking about
kelly,in the background he told everybody so i just want to know is that a baseball term
pam,hey
jim,hey
pam,hows it going down there
jim,its a complete well actually its exactly what youd expect so how are the girls
pam,good we watched a video about our changing bodies
jim,did you really
pam,no laughs
jim,oh
pam,almost
jim,good
pam,um but hey something kind of cool theres this internship in graphic design that jan was telling us about she made it sound like really great
jim,nice well whats it all about
pam,um
jim,i think you should do it thats great
pam,its really cool
michael,cold front coming into the warehouse uh oh better put on your ski boots woohoohoowoo waaaah happy new year darryl heydarryl you ever done this
angela,are you married
jan,im divorced
phyllis,that must have been hard
jan,it was yes
kelly,you were probably feeling really depressed and sad and thats why you did that thing with michael
jan,i think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff
phyllis,mmmm i think were all okay with the balance weve struck
angela,at least you dont have kids you have no kids right thank god
jan,okay lets take five i think we can all use five
kelly,how can someone so beautiful be so sad
michael,hi
jan,did you take care of the situation
michael,yuh yuh yes i i have essentially
jan,excuse me
michael,i have essentially yes ive taken some
jan,excuse me ive been told theres been some interest in forming a union and that michael supported it obviously hes not a friend of yours because he didnt tell you the facts so let me if there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch i can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that snaps her fingers they unionized in pittsfield and we all know what happened in pittsfield it will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs so i would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message if you have any further questions you can direct them to to michael
pam,dreams are just that theyre dreams they help get you through the day like the thing about the terrace its nice but um i dont know it was just something i read in this book when i was twelve the girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and i just loved that just always kind of stuck with me
jim,so youre not doing it
pam,how did you know
jim,why not
pam,just like no big reason just a bunch of little reasons
jim,come on
pam,roys right theres no guarantee its going to lead to anything anyway
jim,roy said that
pam,what you have something you want to say
jim,you got to take a chance on something sometime pam i mean do you want to be a receptionist here always
pam,oh excuse me im fine with my choices
jim,you are
pam,yeah
pam,its impractical im not going to try to get a house like that um they dont even make houses like that in scranton so im never going to
michael,im just going to put this over there
darryl,this is not a good idea right here
michael,you did uh okay
michael,pizza great equalizer rich people love pizza  poor people love pizza  white people love pizza  black people love pizza  do black people like pizza
michael,hey um look guys im sorry sometimes jan can be such a bitch
all the men,generalized mumbling agreement yeah
michael,hey watch it watch it we have a relationship
michael,thank you to our hosts
darryl,hey michael this aint over
michael,ahhh excellent
michael,is it good to be back yeah i mean i love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women you know why because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting

david,thanks very much
josh,thank you
david,ok michael
michael,what is a business is it a collection of numbers and sales reports sure but as you know david and jan it is much more plays video on screen david and jan have confused looks on their faces
michael,video dialogue for the faces of scranton life moves a little slower in scranton pennsylvania and thats the way we like it because at dunder mifflin scranton were not just in the paper business were in the people business lets meet some of the folks that make the scranton branch so special video shows stanley at desk this is stanley hudson one of our talented salesman an africanamerican father of two stanleys dedication is no doubt one of the hallmarks of the foundation of the business were hoping to build our bases on
michael,yeah i shot a bunch of footage around the office edited it together on my mac i was thinking of entering it into some festivals probably wont you know not what this is about
michael,video dialogue and finally pam beesly look at her look how cute not bad at all as the receptionist pam is truly the gateway to our world well i hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at dunder mifflin scranton what its like to walk a mile in oscars shoes or try on phyllis pants  maybe even one of angelas famous brownies and youll know that youre home video says great scott

craig,yeah heres the deal i did not understand this was supposed to be a full on like report or whatnot
jan,um im sorry what did you think financial presentation meant
craig,i was under the impression this was more of like a meet and greet type deal
david,so does that mean you dont have the numbers on your branch
craig,that is correct yes
jan,craig you realize that were trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken
craig,look im sorry i didnt know
jan,well the point is is that doesnt exactly bode well for your branch
craig,oh man you know what michael made that stupid movie he doesnt get into any trouble maybe i should have slept with you too david looks at jan who glares at michael

jim,cuginos pizza
dwight,oh great tasty terrific pizza hmm question do their pizzas play dvds
jim,dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company he wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention it is literally the highest possible honor that a northeastern pennsylvaniabased midsize paper company regional salesman can attain so

michael,grapes seductive so you ready for the big speech this afternoon
dwight,well its not really a big speech you still coming right
michael,oh absofruitly fruit grapes nailed the joke matter of time um and yes it is a big speech biggest of your life
michael,speaker at the sales convention been there done that went there again did it again two years in a row consecutive i just i miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it sir youre awesome heres a plaque what a whole year has gone by and you need more proof heres a certificate they stopped making plaques that year
dwight,what if i give a really long extended thank you for instance thank you mr blank thank you very very very
michael,that would look terrible these are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act
dwight,when i was in the sixth grade i was a finalist in our school spelling bee it was me against raj patel and i misspelled in front of the entire school the word failure
dwight,i cant do this
michael,thats because youre incapable of doing it because you dont know how because you have no skills dwight theres no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time
dwight,oh okay
michael,but i can teach you enough so that you dont embarrass me or the company
dwight,okay deal ill do whatever you say no questions asked
michael,well if you have a question you should ask me
dwight,ill try and think of one when
michael,dont dont try and think of a question to humor me just try not to be such an idiot
dwight,is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice
michael,insult
pam,mom im sorry i know you and dad are chipping in for the wedding but i do not want orange invitations yes well if you really want my
jim,hi yeah can i talk to one of your travel agents

oscar,i get here early every morning so i can set the thermostat i like it a little cooler around 66 degrees im more productive maybe some people dont like it as cold as i do but i dont care
michael,stand up comic voice but seriously whats the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman
dwight,saleswoman has a vagina
michael,its a joke dwight its not a sex ed class
dwight,but im right
michael,yeah youre right about the difference between a man and a woman but not about the punch line to the joke right stand up comic voice the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman is boobs
dwight,hey do you remember the speeches that you gave
michael,i do both of them
dwight,could i have a copy of one of them
michael,no no they would remember them look it doesnt matter what you say it just matters that youre saying something that people care about yeah all right here we go watch this
michael,attention everybody attention please i have some very great news from corporate we had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars
dwight,yeah
michael,generalized clapping and cheering congratulations

michael,as your leader and your friend i sort of demand that you can all speak in public as i can and did twice speaking to camera you saw the plaque right to office all right were all going to go around the room and were going to make toasts and that way we will overcome our fear of public speaking

dwight,yes i am
jim,the great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers they were people of passion so if you want to do well today you got to do what they did
dwight,which is
jim,youve got to wave your arms and youve got to pound your fists many times its supposed to emphasize your point
jim,ok i didnt actually major in public speaking but i did download speeches from some of historys famous dictators like this one holds up paper originally given by benito mussolini

dwight,company policy if drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twentyfour hours
oscar,is that true toby
toby,oh when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing
michael,two nights ago i went to an alicia keys concert at the montage mountain performing arts center i scored these great aisle seats anyway after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and i never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one i dont know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes and im sure that it was clove cigarettes everybody in the aisle was doing it
michael,okay attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled  instead i will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection
dwight,no you cant do that
michael,i can do that it is my office
dwight,no you cannot it has to be official and it has to be urine

kelly,so i was looking so hot
michael,it has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about
phyllis,we dont feel that way
angela,no not at all
oscar,you were the one joking around calling dwight a narc
michael,no uh no that was a test  i was testing you and you all failed miserably when i said that dwight was a narc how many of you defended him  how many of you said hey you know what hes right what hes doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs
dwight,thank you michael
michael,i am ridiculously antidrug so antidrug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion or testing of any kind
michael,drugs ruin lives people drugs destroy careers take cheech and chong everybody knows that cheech and chong are funny but just imagine how funny they would be if they didnt smoke pot  i want everybody to take a look to their left now i want everybody to take a look to their right one of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives this year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children
stanley,where did you get these facts
michael,are these facts scaring you or are they not
stanley,they are not
michael,do you think that smoking drugs is cool do you think that doing alcohol is cool
stanley,no i dont i have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week  for the antioxidants
michael,okay enough enough enough i have written down a list of illegal drugs take a gander how many of these are you familiar with
toby,hookah is not an illegal drug michael

toby,no its not its a type of pipe you can fill it with tobacco often mixed with fruit or other flavors

pam,wow he really pulled out the big guns fake crying did not expect that

toby,michael can i talk to you for a uh second please
michael,yes
toby,heres how i usually handle this all i do is listen
michael,yeah
toby,these things just have a way of working themselves out
michael,okay
toby,its like if you write someone a letter when youre really angry they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days then you just never end up sending it
michael,what do you know about conflict resolution your answer to everything is to get divorced so
toby,okay
michael,okay what
toby,that was the right decision for me and my marriage
michael,yeah well thats not gonna fly here because in this office it is till death do us part assuming we dont get downsized leans over to pam uh pam will you get angela and meet us in the conference room please
michael,holding up a binder a mediators tool chest okay well before we get started you should know that are 5 different styles of conflictin a comedic voice my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style
angela,can we go i have a lot of work to do
michael,no okay this is important the first style is loselose
oscar,whats the next one
michael,just hold on please okay if we do loselose neither of you gets what you want do you understand you you would both lose now i need to ask you do you want to pursue a loselose negotiation
angela,can we just skip to whatever number 5 is  winwin or whatever
michael,winwin is number four and number five is winwinwin the important difference here is with winwinwin we all win me too i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work
michael,in front of poster okay since this is the disputed poster now one at a time i want you to express your feelings using i emotion language and no judging or you statements
angela,i got this poster for christmas and i feel i want to see it everyday it makes me feel like the babies are the true artists and god has a really cute sense of humor
michael,come on seriously that
oscar,i dont like looking at it its creepy and in bad taste and its just offensive to me it makes me think of the horrible frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it its kitsch its the opposite of art it destroys art it destroys souls this is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno im talking about the
michael,okay okay stop stop stop lets see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are winwin
pam,win
michael,yes thank you pam how about angela makes the poster into a tshirt which oscar wears that way he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar she can see it winwinwin
oscar,no
angela,thats no
michael,okay well brainstorm own the solution
angela,how about i leave it up
oscar,how bout she takes it down
pam,how about angela can keep it up on tuesdays and thursdays
michael,okay that is called a compromise and it is style 3 and it is not ideal to sum up winwin  make the poster into a tshirt winlose  take the poster down compromise  tuesdays and thursdays and the answer is make the poster into a tshirt winwin
pam,win
oscar,fine
angela,but it
michael,claps his hands twice it is done
pam,win
photographer,snaps a photo of creed then creed turns to the side for a profile shot no youre all good
creed,great gets up and leaves
pam,hey angelahands her a save the date card i didnt have your zip code
angela,oh thanks
angela,it was hand delivered but i did get a save the date after all its not my taste
toby,you solved it
michael,yes
toby,well good  we can uh throw that one out shuffles through papers
michael,are those all the other complains
toby,mmmhm
michael,i would like to see those please
toby,i i cant do that
michael,you cant do that huh huh ok now you and i have a conflict i order you to give me that file
toby,that shakes head and places hand over the file
michael,okay yanks the file away despite tobys resistance there no more conflict looks at the camera i had to use winlose on that it was not pretty looks back at toby all right is that it
toby,sighs and pulls out a box under his desk its all dwights
toby,every friday at 4 i have a standing appointment with dwight for him to file a grievance against jim i tell him that im sending them to a special file in new york that box is the special file in new york
michael,ohh god alright why do i have to do everything
photographer,are you sure looks at oscar who is front of the camera holding the baby poster in front of his chest
dwight,oh hes sure just shoot
photographer,shoots twice
michael,looking through papers in the complaint box this is from kevin he says stanley uses his miracle whip without asking meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright creed huh duh duh creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist
pam,nice
michael,you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me
toby,actually i have a separate folder for complaints against michael this unlocks a draweris january through march of this year pulls out a fairly large folder
michael,how many of you have at one time gone to toby to complain about another employee looks at all the employees most of whom raise their hands and did you get what you wanted or were you merely listened to you forget about your problem and you move on employees mumble merely listen to and forgotten  that is outrageous i love this place and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering sighs okay today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open where it can be resolved alright how about the phyllisangela dispute
angela,you already did me
michael,thats what she said jim mouths these words along with michael the thing is angela you are in here an awful lot you have complained about everybody in the office except dwight which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with dwight toby by the way what does redacted mean there is a file full of complaints in here marked redacted
toby,yeah it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it so i took their name off
michael,oh ok there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago
dwight,whoa wha wait if someone has a problem with me why would they withdraw it six months ago
pam,notices angelas intense concern um lets move on i volunteer did anyone have a problem with me
michael,all right pamela come on down lets do it and looks through the file okay just one complaint actually it has been withdrawn so that is no help to us next
pam,wait what did it say
michael,uh readingdoes she have to plan her wedding on office time couldnt she do that at home pam looks angela an angry look who else why dont we just warm up first warm up emotionally all right
pam,i have this kind of big secret about angela and ive been really nice to her and i havent told anyone and what the hell
michael,here is a kelly complaint ryan never returns my calls ugh join the club
ryan,my voicemails really spotty sometimes
kelly,i didnt file a complaint i was just talking
toby,to your hr representative
kelly,to my friend i thought i want that withdrawn
toby,fine ill take your name off looks at michael so no one will know
michael,crumbles up the complaint paper makin progress jim raises his hand yes
jim,dwight tried to kiss me
michael,what
jim,and i didnt tell anyone because im not really sure how i feel about it
dwight,that is not true redact it redact it
jim,well im not actually making a formal complaint i just really think we should talk about it
dwight,okay question looks at toby when a name is withdrawn does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in new york
toby,sure
michael,stanley off camera
pam,gets up and walks over to angela whispering to her hey thanks for ratting me out
michael,still of camera you got a lot of anger under there buddy come on start us out unleash it
uncle al,i didnt do it michael and stanley continue to talk off camera but its inaudible
pam,i find that hard to believe considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except bobblehead joe
michael,someone complained that the mens room is whites only stanley you know thats not true
stanley,i didnt say that
creed,then why is there a picture of a white man on the door michael along with the camera look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door
michael,okay phyllis you complained that angelas giving you dirty looks and you tried to get off the party planning committee
phyllis,no i never said any such thing angela and i are close
michael,and also phyllis stanley says that you cry too much and that bugs him
phyllis,stanley and i are close too
stanley,we sit close
michael,oh ok
toby,sits down for his id picture just take it flashes goes off while he is standing back up again
pam,i cant believe angela i went against my better judgment and i gave her a save the date and now it turns out she complained about me to toby
jim,well it was redacted look if she wants an invite maybe shes just trying to be friends
pam,dont take her side
jim,sighs well what does roy think about everything
pam,i dont know i try not to bother him about this kind of stuff
jim,you mean your thoughts and feelings
pam,yeah

phyllis,whispering to angela i dont like you
michael,ok ryan  you told toby that creed has a distinct old man smell
creed,i know exactly what hes talking about i sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer very nutritious but they smell like death
michael,all right kevin you are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to angela that made her feel uncomfortable solution  angela you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to kevin that will make him uncomfortable
kevin,i accept your decision
jim,hey you know what dwight maybe we should get our photo id taken together
dwight,that doesnt make any sense
jim,well it saves time you know cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning walk in together perfect
photographer,to dwight who is sitting in front of the camera smile
dwight,no
dwight,i never smile if i can help it showing ones teeth is a submission signal in primates when someone smiles at me all i see is a chimpanzee begging for its life

jim,that actually took a while i had to put uh more and more nickels into his handset till he got used to the weight and then i just took em all out
michael,reading every time i typed my name it said diapers
jim,just a simple macro you know these actually dont sound that funny one after another but he does deserve it though
michael,by the end of the day my desk was about two feet closer to the copier
jim,yeah i just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom and thats how i spent my entire day that day
michael,the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage where they dig into your body very hard and it is very painful and apparently some people throw up but the next day they feel great ive never had one they sound awful

michael,flashback the photo being taken one twoflash goes off didnt say three did i

female worker,okay jan will see you now

dwight,elevator bell dings what is this what happened here
jim,i dont know
dwight,oh this does not look good did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning

photographer,dwight slurping okay here we go one two
dwight,he sometimes wears glasses write that down also that may not be his real hair
michael,i hate it when people dont tell each other why theyre angry my dad was like that i would say whats wrong dad whats wrong dad whats wrong dad whats wrong dad whats wrong dad whats wrong dad over and over and over and he would just look at me like i was an idiot
dwight,im the one who petitioned the office board to have these id badges taken
photographer,so there were no death threats
dwight,let me see your id
michael,there is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby and they cant decide so they bring the baby to a wise man just like a manager in those days and the wise man says i will adopt this baby and raise it as a hindu see they didnt expect that and that fixed it because i think he was the dad anyway
michael,there are dozens of old complaints in here cold cases like the show imitating gonging and toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murdersuicides are not important enough to solve well you know what i have a problem with that and im going to open up these cases before toby can kill or rape another person
photographer,all right
pam,thats not bad hey do you do weddings
photographer,would you seriously want your wedding photos to look like that
jim,not bad
dwight,i gave her a higher clearance than you

phyllis,come on dwight i think its actually healthy to get it off your chest
dwight,im done talking i am a schrute we dont back down
phyllis,youre arrogant and pompous and i dont like you
michael,cage match i dont know if it was in the packet from corporate because i barely read any of it so if youre asking if i stole their idea the answer is no

dwight,laughs you cant be serious are you serious
jim,ever since i was a little kid like eight or nine i could sort of control things with my mind

dwight,scoffs thats ridiculous you know what uh why dont you move that coat rack excuse me everyone attention in the office please jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence go ahead
jim,okay ill try the coat rack wobbles pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene
dwight,oh my god
michael,i try not to think of it as lagging behind its more of a davidandgoliath thing
jan,on phone yeah but well the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that i oversee
michael,top 80 percent
jan,michael
michael,yeah
jan,you know that im very serious here
michael,jan listen i promise that i will kick it up a notch bam
jan,what

michael,okay everybody tonights event is to benefit the boy scouts of america
oscar,again we do that every year
michael,well they need our money they dont have cookies like the girl scouts
oscar,itd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering
michael,well oscar if you dont like it then you should concentrate on winning because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice and they will get a minifridge compliments of vance refrigeration
dwight,yes
michael,so get your charities in to pam i for example am playing for comic relief
jim,that doesnt exist anymore
michael,comedy is very much alive as are homeless people
pam,no they stopped making that show
michael,well then they need our money more than ever
angela,you have to pick an approved nonprofit organization
creed,theres a great soup kitchen in downtown scranton delicious pea soup on thursdays ill probably give the money to them
kevin,something with animals or people
kelly,kobe bryant has a foundation and he is so hot and he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring i know he didnt do it maybe he did it
angela,we are giving money that has been gambled why dont we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves  and donate that money to charity
michael,oh and another fun thing we at the end of the night are going to give the check to an actual group of boy scouts right toby were gonna
toby,actually i didnt think it was appropriate to invite children since its you know theres gambling and alcohol and its in our dangerous warehouse and its a school night and you know hooters is catering you know is that enough should i keep going
michael,why are you the way that you are honestly every time i try to do something fun or exciting you make it not that way i hate so much about the things that you choose to be okay you know what i will not donate my winnings to comic relief since apparently it doesnt exist i am going to donate to afghanistanis with aids
jim,i think you mean the aid to afghanistan

michael,exactly
toby,i mean for real
michael,yeah i know
toby,no i mean hes attracted to other men
michael,ok a little too far crossed the line
toby,ok i am telling you oscar is an actual homosexual  yeah he told me this morning  and obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion
michael,i would have never called him that if i knew  you dont you dont call retarded people retards  its bad taste  you call your friends retards when theyre acting retarded  and i consider oscar a friend
michael,listen man i am so sorry  i had no idea
oscar,no its fine
michael,no  no its not  i feel terrible about it  i have been calling people faggie since i was in junior high and i have never made this mistake  if i dont know how to behave it is because i am just so far the opposite way you know  im just i i cant even imagine the thing  maybe we could go out for a beer sometime  and you could tell me how you do that to another dude
oscar,that sounds like a great wonderful idea lets do that
angela,in reference to oscar being gay it explains so much
oscar,no im not gay  and i dont understand why anyone would think that im gay if sighs uh yeah im gay
jim,i cant say whether dunder mifflin paper is less flammable sir but i can assure that it is certainly not more flammable
jim,why did i transfer to stamford  i think thats pretty obvious  i got promoted  and you cant beat that view right
andy,hey big tuna  youre single right
jim,uhhuh yeah  i am
andy,shes pretty hot huh jim nods  shes completely crazy  steer clear big tuna  head for open waters
jim,ooook
andy,ooook
jim,i ate a tuna sandwich on my first day  so andy started calling me big tuna  i dont think any of them actually know my real name
andy,big tuna is a super ambitious guy you know  cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy but i mean im not threatened by him  i went to cornell you ever heard of it laughs  i graduated in four years  i never studied once  i was drunk the whole time and i sang in the acappella group here comes treble
josh,so end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher because of some more problems at the scranton branch  and i have a list of business startups i got from the chamber  yes i am going to need someone to cold call them
jim,oh i can do that
karen,jims nice enough  i dont i dont know how well hes fitting in here hes always looking at the camera like this  makes classic jimcamera face what is that
michael,can you tell whos gay and whos not
dwight,of course
michael,what about oscar
dwight,absolutely not
michael,well he is
dwight,well hes not dressed in womens clothes so
michael,deep sigh there could be others  i need to know  i dont want to offend anybody else
dwight,you could assume everyone is and not say anything offensive
michael,yeah im sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay
michael,hey what about angela   shes hard and severe  she could be a gay woman
dwight,i really dont think so
michael,i dont know i can imagine her with another woman cant you
dwight,creepy smile
michael,do some research  find out if theres a way to tell by just looking at them
dwight,jim told me you could buy gaydar online
michael,thats ridiculous
dwight,yeah probably  he didnt tell the truth a lot
michael,sighs lets call him and get the website
dwight,definitely
jim,whats gaydar  oh oh gaydar yes  no uh i think they have it at sharper image  oh you know what  i could check for you  no problem  loudly fake typing  its sold out  yeah sorry about that thats a bummer
michael,well theyre sold out
dwight,damn  thinks  ill try brookstone
jim,i miss that
roy,chicken or fish
pam,loud sigh chicken
roy,so you havin a good day
pam,excellent thanks
roy,good glad  ok
pam,yeah i didnt go through with the wedding  i got cold feet a few days before  and i cant really explain it  i just had to get out of that relationship  we still had to pay for all the food  so we froze it  but im im doing well  i have my own apartment  im taking art classes  and i have lunch for the next five weeks
roy,after pam dumped me i um i kinda stopped taking care of myself there and uh i hit bottom when uh drunk driving arrest  ive been working out and um you know im not gonna take her for granted  i gotta win her back
stanley,i got them a toaster  they called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me  i tried to return the toaster to the store and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster  so now my house has got two toasters
kelly,that is so cool that youre gay  i totally underestimated you
oscar,yes im super cool  i am an accountant at a failing paper supply company scranton  much like um sir ian mcclellan
angela,sure sometimes i watch will and grace and i want to throw up  its terribly loud  i do like it sometimes when harry connick jr is on  hes so talented
andy,ok  who put my calculator in jello  good one  but uh seriously guys who did this  seriously guys who did this  i need to know who put my calculator in jello or im gonna lose my frickin mind
jan,you know its amazing to me that in this day and age you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation
michael,i watch the l word  i watch queer as f so
jan,thats not what its called
toby,ok michael are you aware that you ousted oscar today
michael,what  what does that even
jan,coming out is a significant moment for a gay person and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it
michael,well gay pride right gay pride parade  its not like gay shame festival
toby,all right now oscars feeling discriminated against by his coworkers primarily angela and um thats your fault
michael,i think angela might be gay  could oscar and angela be having a gay affair  maybe  is that what this is about
jan,no
michael,i dont kn
jan,no its not possible
michael,anythings possible
jan,you know imagine you were gay
michael,laughs well im not gay jan and you should know that better than anybody
jan,michael your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now  do you understand
michael,the company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100000 years of being weirded out by gays
oscar,am i the first gay man you ever knew
michael,trick question  cause you cant always tell so how would i know  is that the right answer
pam,michael dwights looking at gay pornography on his computer
dwight,uh michael knows pam  he asked me to do this just for him  he has his own reasons
michael,looking at gay porn nothing wrong with this stuff  at all  this is fine  you know what  gay porn straight porn its all goooooood  i dont particularly get into this  but uh you know what  i totally see the merit  and actually it is quite beautiful
dwight,ah damn popups
oscar,what are you doing
angela,watching some of your friends
michael,yelling all right everybody in the conference room  i dont care if you are gay or straight or a lesbian or overweight  just get in here  right now
michael,did you know that gay used to mean happy  when i was growing up it meant lame  and now it means a man who makes love to other men
michael,were all homos  homosapiens  gays arent necessarily who you think they are people  i mean anybody could be gay  businessmen  like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants  oscar why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here  however you want to do it  go ahead  stand up  im doing this for you
oscar,yes im gay  and i didnt plan on sharing that part of my life with you today so whatever  can i sit down now
creed,im not offended by homosexuality  in the sixties i made love to many many women often outdoors in the mud and the rain  and it was possible a man slipped in and there would be no way of knowing
michael,who should be the judges and juries of our society
angela,judges and juries
michael,yes thats a good point  she has a good point  because gay marriage currently is not legal under us law  i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them  so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could  you know  sounds pretty good right
kevin,that sounds great
dwight,i think all the other office gays should identify themselves or i will do it for them
oscar,no one else in this office is gay
dwight,what about phyllis  she makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine
phyllis,im getting married to bob vance
michael,thats great  congratulations phyllis  that is great and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing  laughs see  everybody has a chance
michael,but still phyllis in college  did you ever experiment with other women  a lot of women do
phyllis,no you knew me in high school  course we all thought you were gay in high school
michael,laughing right  serious and i take that as a compliment
phyllis,well with your ties and your matching socks and
michael,well i just like to look good ok so
oscar,you sound pretty defensive michael
michael,no i am just coming out myself  i am coming out hetero
oscar,i think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here
michael,no no no  the only signal that i am sending is  gay good
michael,look if i was gay i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen  i would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just i would be waving that rainbow flag
oscar,i dont think i can work here any longer  this has been the worst most backwards day of my life
michael,you misunderstand ok  you know what ok  i uh im gonna put my money where my mouth is  you ready  i am going to embrace oscar  you might want to watch this angela because you cant catch anything  here we go  we are going to make a statement  you and i are going to make a statement together  oscar is my friend
oscar,i would rather not
michael,and i just dont care who sees it doesnt bother me
oscar,no no  i dont want to touch you ever consider that  youre ignorant and insulting and small
michael,all right um sorry
oscar,michael im sorry  that was a good idea  come on come on oscar and michael hug
michael,sobbing im sorry i called you faggie  youre not faggie  youre a a good guy
dwight,michael appears to be gay too  and yet he is my friend  i guess i do have a gay friend
michael,embracing oscaryou know what im going to raise the stakes  i want you to watch this  and i want you to burn this into your brains  because this is an image that i want you people to remember for a long time to come  whenever you come into the office i want you to think about this  awkwardly kissing oscar  i did it  see  im still here  were all still here everyone claps
michael,dwight gets up to kiss oscar  oh come on  dwight  come on man
michael,we are not in the playground anymore  there are new rules  we have to be mature  but we cant lose the spirit of child like wonder  what is love  anyway  maybe its supposed to break all the rules  like me and jan  or oscar and some guy  life is short  when two people find each other what should stand in their way
michael,i am glad that today spurred social change  thats part of my job as regional manager  but you know what  even if it didnt at least we put this matter to bed  thats what she said  or he said
michael,oh theres gill  oscars roommate  i wonder if he knows
oscar,i was going to quit  but jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car  all i had to do was sign something saying i wont sue  gill and i are going to europe  kids sometimes it pays to be gay
dwight,reading the note with the gaydar  hope this helps  jim  nice
oscar,dwight is running the gaydar over oscars body  what are you doing
dwight,shhh  dont be scared  gaydar beeps over oscars belt buckle dwight smiles it works  gaydar goes off next to dwights belt buckle  oh no
jan,on speakerphone okay what is your goal for after lunch
michael,i will do my job to the best of my abilities
jan,under breath heaven help us aloud specifically
michael,i will do my regional manager job to the best of my capability
jan,specifically michael
michael,specifically jan i will make at least ten phone calls to clients
michael,yes i have to begin every day by letting jan know what i intend to accomplish and then i have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what i did accomplish but its not mandatory its something that i wanted to do and so its voluntary really even though she makes me i think she just wants to hear my voice because were no longer lovers and shes just hurting but things are going well with carol ive seen her seven times in the last few months and im growing very fond of her kids tommy who i call tomas and the little girl
jan,on speakerphone are you on the toilet michael

michael,thoughtfully a statue
jan,of ed
michael,yeah
jan,scoffs im not sure thats realistic
michael,well i think it would be very realistic it would look just like him
jan,no thats not
michael,we could have his eyes light up we could have his arms move
dwight,that is not a statue that is a robot
michael,i think that is a great way to honor ed
dwight,and how big do you want this robot
michael,lifesize
dwight,mm no  better make it twothirds  easier to stop if it turns on us

michael,i am going to throw you this ball  when you catch the ball i want you to say the name of a person very important to you somebody really special who died and then i want you to say how they died and you may cry if you like that is encouraged  let me just start  let me show you how this works   i catch the ball  i lost ed truck  and it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears and at the same time somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone and im crying and nobody can hear me because i am terribly terribly terribly alone
roy,excuse me im sorry to interrupt uh i need to see pam  there seems to be like something wrong with the radiator in her car

pam,did i wake up this morning thinking id be throwing together a bird funeral  you never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into
karen,spotting herrs chips on her desk whered you find them
jim,whered i find what
jim,i called the manufacturer who referred me to distributor who referred me to the vending machine company who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door
michael,glad you could all make it
kelly,you told us we had to
michael,dwight do you have the box
pam,actually i have it
michael,you made this  wow impressed thats thats very nice
ryan,when i was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it  and i remember thinking im a little too old for this  and i was five
pam,id also like to say a few words if thats okay
michael,yes
pam,what do we know about this bird  you might think not much  its just a bird  but we do know some things  we know it was a local bird  maybe its that same bird that surprised oscar that one morning with a special present from above
kevin,oh i remember that  that was so funny
pam,and we know how he died  flying into the glass doors  but you know what  i dont think he was being stupid  i think he just really really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song
dwight,hes not a songbird
michael,shhh
pam,an impression then  lastly we cant help but notice that he was by himself when he died but of course we all know that doesnt mean he was alone  because im sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much  he will not be forgotten
angela,quickly amen
dwight,begins playing recorder
pam,singing just smile for me and let the day begin  you are the sunshine that lights my heart within on the wings of love
michael,society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong well thats baloney because grief isnt wrong there is such a thing as good grief just ask charlie brown
dwight,lets get back to work
hannah,hey jimmy want to see some pictures of my baby
jim,umm sure
hannah,shows picture here he is
jim,chuckles hes so cute
hannah,and heres his first bath warning contains nudity
jim,thats okay hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby oh no its not im sorry is that your husband in the tub with him
hannah,you think we should have left our baby in the tub alone jim shakes head talk to me when you have kids
jim,sounds good
jan,on the phone ed truck died over the weekend
michael,oh wow he
jan,yeah and i know i know he was your boss so i thought you should know
michael,does his family know
jan,yes they know michael
michael,but im the first in the office
jan,i guess yes i think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team in case they want to pay their respects
michael,okay yes sure i will do that
jan,good
michael,cause im the first to to find out nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them well good how are you holding up want me to come over jan hangs up
michael,ed truck died and it blows they say that with grief time makes it worse which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so ive had more time to be sad
dwight,attention everyone as you know ed truck is dead if you have any contact information on rolodex files or in microsoft outlook remove it now also if you have any photographs pam will make her shredder available during lunch that is all
dwight,remembering the dead doesnt help anybody the way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again in this case some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body im working on both
michael,i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor we need to find out what is blocking you and that way well be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored may he rest in peace
kevin,ces chuckles
michael,what was that kevin
kevin,nothing
michael,no you said something didnt you
kevin,may he rest in pieces chuckles you know because theres like two pieces of him
michael,you think thats funny
kevin,no chuckles
michael,you are disgusting
dwight,michael no need to call corporate we are supposed to use toby hes trained as a grief counselor
michael,no that cant be right
toby,well i am trained in grief counseling but ahh i dont think thats what they need right now
michael,well then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world doesnt it
roy,hey there
pam,hi
roy,so hows your day going
pam,well i will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone ive never met
roy,that sucks laughs you guys got it much harder up here
pam,closer to the epicenter i guess
roy,laughs cool all right
toby,well as you know ed truck passed away so im here to talk about it if anyone would like to
kevin,not really
michael,youre ruining it already they should not be given the choice
ryan,i did not know ed truck so i will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend i think ed would have wanted it that way
toby,is anyone having any trouble eating
kevin,no
toby,concentrating is anyone having trouble getting their work done today
stanley,im having trouble getting my work done today
toby,well look sometimes things crop up later so uhh you should know im always available if anyone would like to talk
michael,wow wow no no you are the most heartless soulless person ive ever met
toby,michael im sorry
michael,no no shh enough it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here dwight ryan i want you to take the table out were gonna go on a five minute break and when you come back were going to start with a clean slate and in the interim i would like you to forget everything that toby has said okay
michael,i dont think im overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company and he is worthless you give people a chance to shine and they blow it just like you knew they would grief counseling is not about are you hungry would you like a sandwich these people are so far gone you have to stick a food tube down their throats
michael,okay part of the problem was that toby talked at you now i am going to talk with you first off i want you to be comfortable because you really cant grieve if youre all tight and buttoned up so guys loosen your ties just take your jackets off if you want ladies let your hair down you know what even take your shoes off i wanna get personal and i want you all to really open up and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said
angela,okay i dont think kevin should take his shoes off
kevin,my feet do not smell angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition
michael,i found an exercise in tobys binder that he managed to miss that involves screening the part of you that says i dont wanna do that i dont wanna talk about that that is too private heres how it works im going to throw you this ball
toby,yeah the ballthrowing exercise is in the binder its in the section marked fun ways to make brainstorming sessions explode with excitement and creativity
roy,hey my cousin billy they just had the twins
pam,really
roy,yeah
pam,wow i thought that was supposed to be like next month
roy,yeah i know i guess they couldnt wait ill bring in a picture if you
pam,yeah id love to see them oh and tell them i say congratulations
roy,sure
pam,i should probably head back in
roy,yeah
pam,but umm thanks for the break
roy,no problem
michael,in his office playing with a dunder mifflin truck when it drops and the head of the truck comes off
pam,michael once told me that home alone is the saddest movie ever when i asked him why he said because the whole family forgets the kid at home there is nothing funny about that

dwight,sorry i just feel like we havent talked in awhile
michael,well we have nothin to talk about dwight just do your work  while you still can
dwight,when you become close with someone you develop a kind of sixth sense you can read their moods like a book and right now the title of michaels book is something weird is going on colon what did jan say the michael scott story by michael scott with dwight schrute
karen,hey um did you hear about your friends in pennsylvania rumor has it that the scranton branch is clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head

kelly,if i get to stay and ryan is laid off i will kill myself like romeo and juliet the claire danes one
andy,surrounded by clapping coworkers stamford connecticut stamford connecticut
jim,i worked in scranton for a really long time and uh its going to be weird that its all disappearing i mean i always knew that the branch would shut down someday i just figured it would be because michael sold the building for some magic beans

jim,seriously youre going to sit in the back
dwight,uh yeah its the safest part of the car in the event of a crash the driver always protects his side of the car first
michael,here we go
andy,in order to take down dwight i have to chip away at his ally which in this case is michael heres the good news every success ive ever had at my job or with the ladyfolk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down
andy,whats the deal with dwight doing your laundry
michael,ugh that is a long story um couple of months ago dwight tried to go behind my back with jan and get my job and i am now having him do my laundry as punishment
andy,wow that is a long story but quite well told michael i find it very interesting especially about the part dwight going behind your back and basically like being a terrible person you know if you want your laundry done right i used to work at abercrombie so pretty good folder
angela,hey pam would you like to go with me to grab a coffee
pam,really
angela,yeah i could use some fresh air might be fun
pam,ok sure
angela,ok

stanley,you want the lead
ryan,yeah if you dont mind
stanley,mind nothing would delight me more
dwight,leave the keys
jim,you still do that thing
dwight,leave the keys
andy,i think you have assembled an amazing team at scranton its really a pleasure to be a part of it its like everyone has their own special skill you know just like the superfriends except for dwight who is more like a superdud i mean he would be a superfriend if there was a superfriend whose super power was always being late you know
michael,hawkman
andy,my plan is taking longer than i thought but i dont give up easily i have walked two marathons
michael,walks out of the ladies restroom lets go the mens room was disgusting
jim,after you sir
dwight,no thank you i never let anyone walk behind me seven out of ten attacks are from the rear
jim,ok well that still leaves a 30 chance that i will attack you from the front
dwight,uh yeah but it will be easier to stop i can always block the blow i can counter it with jim slaps dwight
pam,angela you seem so happy i bet you wish you were like this all the time
angela,this friend of mine  lets call her noelle  she missed this deadline turning something in to corporate in new york but then this gallant gentleman  well call him kurt  he drove all the way to new york and handed it in for her thats i dont know i guess he really just likes her a lot
pam,thats great
angela,yes it is walks up to the counter where there is no employee hello
michael,hey did you catch that up at lake wallenpaupack

andy,caught an eightypound shark off of montauk its in the hamptons my dads got a 42ft bayliner sniped it with a rifle from the crows nest also shot a deer once
michael,you know what lets get right down to it dundermifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse but what we lack in flash we will make up for with hardwork and decency
andy,ok this is the classic undersell because you should know we dont work out of a log cabin we trade on the new york stock exchange ever heard of it its in new york
buyer,uh i have to say i am a little wary with getting involved with a big company weve had some problems in the past
michael,i think what andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company we will give you the care and attention of a small company
andy,oh man that is like poetry
michael,no
andy,i swear this guy could sell paper to a tree
michael,stop it puts his hand on andys shoulder stop it
andy,ow
pam,dunder mifflin this is pam excited this is pam i did

kevin,youre wearing a womans suit
michael,no i do i i wear mens suits ok  i got this out of a bin
michael,there were these huge bins of clothes and everybody was rifling through them like crazy and i grabbed one  and it fit  so i dont think that this is totally just a womans suit  at the very least its bisexual
kevin,who makes it
michael,uh reading the inside of his jacket missterious  and it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side thats the mystery
phyllis,look its got shoulderpads and did you see that lining
michael,okay
phyllis,did you see
michael,would you stop it please
jim,so none of that tipped you off
michael,its european ok  its a european cut
pam,michael the pants dont have any pockets

darryl,yeah he look like hillary clinton
michael,um lets just do this in 15 minutes
darryl,okay can you just stand right there  snaps camera phone picture i gotta send some emails
michael,negotiations are all about controlling things  about being in the drivers seat  and make one tiny mistake youre dead  i made one tiny mistake  i wore womans clothes
kevin,karen how do you feel that roy tried to kick your boyfriends ass over another woman
karen,i feel great kevin  thank you
stanley,you must have been scared out of your mind
karen,well you know it happened so fast i didnt really have time to be scared
angela,what happened exactly  i wasnt here so i havent really heard the whole story
karen,um well jim and i were talking and roy walked in looking super angry
angela,mmhmm
karen,and hes a big dude you know  and all of a sudden jim pushed me out of the way and roy cocked his fist and then bam dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt
angela,flustered goodness
karen,when i heard jim and pam had kissed my reaction was to have lots of long talks with jim about our feelings  roy just attacked him  im not sure which one jim hated more
michael,lets get down to business  why dont you tell me why you think you deserve a raise
darryl,well its simple mike i mean we merged these two branches right  so now were shipping twice as many orders as we used to  with roy gone we got a smaller crew  and im pickin up all of his slack so i think i should be compensated fairly by gettin a raise
michael,mumbles jibberish
darryl,what  i cant hear you
michael,mumbling softly that was a very good point
darryl,i cant what mike  are you
michael,mumbling softly you make a very compelling argument
pam,sorry i almost got you killed
jim,yeah that was nuts
pam,he could have broken your nose or something  crazy  its just so stupid  i mean getting back with roy and everything  i mean what was i thinking right
jim,no i mean you guys really seem to have a strong connection
pam,not anymore  its um its completely over now
jim,well see  im sure you guys will find you way back to one another someday
pam,jim i am really sorry
jim,oh yeah  dont worry about it
michael,i am going to give you a piece of paper  i want you to write down how much you want and i want you to slide it back across the desk to me
darryl,why cant i just tell you
michael,because that is the way these things are done  in films darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to michael no slide slide it yes
darryl,there you go
michael,oh scoffs come on  be serious
darryl,i am serious mike  thats a 10 raise  thats what i want
michael,i i cant give you that i i dont make this much
darryl,come on be for real mike
michael,i dont  want me to prove it to you  there is a pay stub
darryl,laughs are you serious  youre earning this
michael,plus perks yes

michael,fourteen years
darryl,hoho
michael,no please please
darryl,oh im sorry mike some of my folks got to hear about this one  texting on cell phone ah laughs
michael,ok lets take 15 again
michael,a bosss salary isnt just about money it is about perks  it for example every year i get a $100 gas card cant put a price tag on that
jim,ok if you dont want a gift at least let me buy you a beer or lunch or something
dwight,when han solo returns to the death star in the millennium falcon and shoots down the tie fighters and saves the rebel cause do you think he does so for a free beer
jim,boy i
dwight,no  and why are you so interested in buying me something jim whats your angle
jim,its like when he annoys me and i want to screw with him to get him back he never sees it coming  but now i want to be nice to him and actually give him something and hes like an eel  i just cant grab onto him  its infuriating
karen,maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks
jim,well yes thats probably what it is  so what do i do
karen,hmm  i dont know  maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip
kevin,michael heres the uh $15 i owe you
michael,oh thank you
kevin,yeah  i heard you might need it  so

michael,well what am i supposed to do
darryl,get your own raise  you gotta get out there and earn son
michael,im not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now  that is ridiculous
darryl,well when they merged the two branches together they put you in charge  okay and were shippin more now than we ever have

darryl,we do safety training every year or after an accident  weve never made it a full year  this particular time i was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf when one office worker who shall remain nameless kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled
michael,barely keeping his composure hey darryl hows it hangin laughs
darryl,and i fell and busted my ankle  im legitimately scared for my workers
darryl,the baler can flatten a car engine  it can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat

darryl,there is no occasion for you to go near this stuff okay
michael,toby now has the floor  and he is going to try not to screw this up like everything else in his life  let me rephrase that  i believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as darryl  here we go
toby,ok um one thing that youre gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome  its recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour  for your circulation youre gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh and move around about ten minutes every hour
michael,yes good  fine  like stretching and
toby,um yeah  youre computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes so uh its also recommended that you step away for about about ten minutes every hour
michael,wow that is that time really adds up  thats like a half an hour every hour
darryl,take them at the same time
michael,ok you know what  youre making it sound kind of lame so skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff  like sometimes computers can explode can they not
toby,no no  um you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort in case it gets drafty
ryan,what about a long sleeve t
toby,well thatll work
kevin,long johns  a shaw
toby,you know anything that warms you

pam,its really hard to demonstrate depression  their safety training had visuals

toby,i was at a parentteacher conference
michael,uhhuh prove it lets see your penis everyone is shocked exhalesi you know as that was coming out of my mouth i knew that it was wrong
michael,in all the excitement i forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe women cant have fun if they dont feel safe for example jan and i have a safe word in case things go too far foliage and if one of us says that word the other one has to stop although last time she pretended she didnt hear me
jan,on speakerphone michael

jan,you know whatever just let my assistant know if youre coming over so he can get more vodka ok hunter are you on
hunter,on speakerphone you got it jan
dwight,employees of this office are very small and delicate deserve  protection from local pervs better 1000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free

dwight,agreed let me show you what ive been working on
michael,ok

dwight,look at that one
michael,dwight are those your pants thats a polaroid dwight takes the polaroid and crumples it in his hand
michael,attention everybody dwight has something he would like to say
dwight,due to a recent incident involving phyllis a man a map and his penis  i think you know what im referring to  michael has authorized me to form an emergency antiflashing task force
jim,raises hand question wont that interfere with your other task forces
dwight,answer no because this is being given priority one this is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot and i know i know what youre thinking pam nods wont that just shed more light on the penises but that is a risk we have to take pam you can draw kind of why dont you work with  phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that i can post around the community
pam,phallus
dwight,phyllis sorry ive got penises on the brain back to work everybody
pam,i dont often miss roy but i can tell you one thing i wish someone had flashed me when i was with roy because that would have been the asskicking of the year small laugh especially if it had been jim he would not have wanted me to have seen jims whoo i am i am saying a lot of things
phyllis,i didnt really get a good look
pam,thats ok i dont feel like answering phones
karen,hey did you guys see this memo that dwight sent out reads memo women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 14 inch females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by dwight schrute this is ridiculous
dwight,attention i am removing all bananas from the kitchen
karen,dwight this memo that you distributed is insulting
dwight,desperate times call for desperate measures
pam,reads memo sleeves down to the wrists buttonedup collars and muted colors nobody dress like that camera pans over to angela
michael,ok you know something dwight we are not the terrorists why dont you just take these women put em in a burlap sack and hit em with a stick because thats what youre doing i celebrate these women they deserve the right to dress as they please if pam wants to show more cleavage she should be able to i encourage that

michael,i um would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter
creed,are we still discussing this i say again what is the big deal
michael,nobody likes to be flashed when meredith flashed me at that christmas party i nearly vomited
meredith,i dont remember doing that
angela,what a surprise
michael,ok no catfights please lets  my point is my point is a penis when seen in the right context is the most wonderful sight for a woman but in the wrong context it is like a monster movie
dwight,alien blagh
michael,what are shut it shut up ok so what i want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about womens problems and issues and situations magazines and tv shows and movies portray women as skinny tall goddesses well look around are women like that no no they are not points to pam even the hot ones arent really that skinny so what does that say that says that you women are up against it and it is criminal society doesnt care society sucks i dont even consider myself a part of society fyi because i am so angry over all of this
andy,if it were up to me you ladies would be the fashion models
kevin,yes andy then the fashion models could come here and work with me
karen,what youre saying is extremely misogynistic

karen,that  its the same thing
phyllis,michael

karen,can we just get back to work
michael,ye  ok yes
angela,this is not work talk

karen,frankly its kind of insulting but i have a bunch of stuff i need to return in my car so i could do that
angela,malls are just awful and humiliating theyre just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a juniors section there are petite adults who are sort of smaller who need to wear maybe a kids size 10
michael,ok lets go ladies of dundermifflin hey we should have a calendar printed up pam put that in my good idea folder pam nods lets go

michael,being the boss is also about image  ive never looked like that that was gross i just i dont see the connection between a firewalk and management worst seventyfive bucks i ever spent you know what if i had to pick my replacement based on today it would be mr outside hire
angela,or mrs outside hire
michael,yeah  ummm hmm true  look i dont want to leave this branch that i love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round to test the aspect of my job that i think is the most important something i call the bob hope factor

michael,god hes a comedian
kelly,oh like amanda bynes
michael,whos amanda bynes
kelly,shes from what a girl wants
michael,oh i love that movie yes kelly is right the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope  so without further ado jim and dwight show us what you got
jim,hey i know what youre looking for but um i got to be honest i really dont think i should be considered as your replacement

angela,i wouldnt put it past her
dwight,so what do you need me to do
angela,i wrote it out
dwight,mmhmm
angela,theres a diabetes shot roll the insulin in your hand dont shake it she gets an ace inhibitor with her meal but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she wont see it because of the cataracts mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine um and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after shes eaten and oh and theres a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail so youre gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail

oscar,dwight please
michael,dwight you havent seen meredith yet have you
dwight,no i have not
michael,well i think you should go to the hospital and pay your respects
dwight,i do not respect her but i will go
michael,alright i would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs
toby,oh michael you cant ask about religious beliefs
michael,satan is a master of lies everything he says is the opposite
toby,alright well then you can ask about religious beliefs
michael,thank you for the permission psych alright lets just go around the room and tell me what you believe in
stanley,im um catholic
michael,ok
darryl,presbyterian
michael,alright
pam,oh me too
darryl,oh
pam,puts hand up for high five same religion
darryl,alright high fives pam
phyllis,im a lutheran and bobs a unitarian it keeps things spicy
angela,thats why were cursed
creed,ive been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower you have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader
michael,kelly you are hindu so you believe in buddha
kelly,thats buddhist
michael,are you sure
kelly,no
michael,what are you
it tech guy,well if youre going to reduce my identity to my religion then im sikh but i also like hiphop and npr and im restoring a 1967 corvette in my spare time
michael,ok 1 sikh and
dwight,as a farmer i know that when an animal is sick sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery with the electricity were using to keep meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days you tell me whats unethical
dwight,blink once if you want me to pull the plug
meredith,dont pull any plugs
intern,how are you doing ms palmer
meredith,better
intern,excellent
dwight,are you a doctor or a male nurse
intern,um im an intern which makes me a doctor but
dwight,pfft her chart doesnt indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did or at least she got time off for one
intern,ah so uh so that is where her uterus went um ms palmer your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago
meredith,yes dwight here trapped it in a bag against my head
dwight,just doing my job
intern,it also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon
meredith,and a rat separate occasions
michael,you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you and then you run over one person with your car sighs and its not even one of the popular ones and everybody gets on your case doesnt make any sense god is dead
kelly,if there was a god then ryan and i would be married by now
michael,maybe believing in god was the mistake what did people believe in before the sun maybe theres some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice too like a giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer with ah the body of a porcupine
jim,i will do some research
pam,i can help you with that
dwight,so just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine
michael,oh god rabies
dwight,mmhmm
michael,i was in the hospital room with her how contagious is that is that like an std
dwight,no no youve gotta be bitten by something
michael,this place is so cursed
dwight,actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in lock jaw
michael,walks out into the office i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering merediths life by hitting her with my car but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it
jim,six of one really
michael,turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis thanks to me she went to the hospital and i saved her life curse is broken curse is broken people kevin claps oh there is a god and he has a plan for us after all so go home get some rest very very good work today we got a lot accomplished
michael,is there a god if not what are all the churches for and who is jesus dad
kevin,pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying oh well if they arent together now then they probably never will be i thought theyd be good together like pbj pam beasley and jim what a waste what  a  waste
pam,pams car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road i told you im not dating anyone and even if i was i dont think its anyones business i mean when i do fall in love like when its for real the last person im gonna talk about it too is a camera crew or my coworkers jim gets into the passenger side almost marrying roy anderson was as close to pamela anderson as i ever want to be jim leans over and kisses pam trust me when i fall in love youll know
pam,michael scotts dundermifflin scranton meredith palmer memorial celebrity rabies awareness fun run race for the cure this is pam
michael,proam
pam,proam race for the they hung up
michael,a woman shouldnt have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies but that is where we are in america and that does not sit right with me and that is why im hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies a disease that has largely been eradicated in the us but not very many people know that
stanley,on the phone no rabies babies would be a good idea can i put you down for a dime
michael,hi stanley how many sponsors so far
stanley,zero
michael,come on man gotta step it up its for a good cause jan called this morning and pledged $50000

michael,alright alright
kevin,you didnt run for me
michael,shhh
kevin,when i thought i had skin cancer
michael,i know that youre probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts
kevin,no
michael,ok well back in olden times a large fat person like this was a person of power a person who had money could buy food person of respect like the regional manager of the day whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was someone who worked in the fields and i was a peasant
kevin,i just dont want to run i didnt bring my sneakers or my clothes
michael,well youre going to have to run or youre going to be in a lot of trouble it is not olden times anymore
andy,in bathroom im petrified of nipple chafing once it starts it is a vicious circle if you have sensitive nipples they chafe so they become more sensitive so they chafe more so i take precautions tapes a cotton ball to each nipple
andy,hey angela hey um im sorry about your cat angela starts to cry
angela,this is sprinkles holds up a picture she was my best friend i kept her going through countless ailments i asked dwight schrute to feed her once and she is now deceased this is halloween last year picture of angela holding sprinkles just a couple of kittens starts to cry out on the town
angela,pssst im having relationship problems and since youre always having relationship problems i thought youd be able to give me some advice
pam,whats wrong
angela,i have this crazy thought that i know is crazy that maybe dwight killed my cat
pam,hmm
angela,when i got home sprinkles body was in the freezer where dwight said he left her but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds
pam,ah
angela,somethings not right the vets doing an autopsy

angela,oh really
dwight,sighs youll feel better after the 5k exercise is good for depression
angela,pushes her chair into dwights legs im not depressed im in grief
michael,we have raised almost $70000 most of it from me and jan um when do they put that on the giant check or is that something that we write in later
pam,well a giant check costs about $20000 to make up i have a print shop standing by but what do you think michael thats over 25 of our funds
michael,hmm thats a tough decision um i always imagined it with a giant check so
jim,yeah i mean i personally am definitely on board for the giant check
pam,giant check it is
jim,yeah
michael,yep
dwight,well i dont know on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control
jim,bat birth control
dwight,wait this money is going to bat birth control right michael thats what you told me when i contributed
michael,you didnt contribute very much i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor and hows that been going
pam,not well a doctor wont come out to collect a check for $70000 or $50000 if we go with the giant check
jim,which we are
pam,and also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor
michael,what about a rabies nurse
pam,i dont think so
jim,you know what though ive actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour for parties and bachelor events
michael,thats possible look into that
jim,great its gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah oh actually more with tips
dwight,maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for merediths son
michael,have you met that kid hes not going to college
pam,michael 5k means 5 kilometers not 5 thousand miles knocks
michael,come in
pam,hey

jim,you couldnt have taken off all your clothes in the mens room
michael,yes but i have an office so why would i do that
pam,on average how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office just ballpark

pam,i didnt see where it started but i saw where it ended
jim,sighs gross
michael,thats not gross it is the human body what is your problem pam youre an artist right think of me as one of your models ok you know what i dont want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today its not fair to people with rabies and thats the point right ok lets go have some fun
jim,alright
pam,they say if youre nervous around someone you should picture them naked i do not recommend this strategy try picturing them with more clothes on or a funny coat
jim,naked from chest up oh im sorry is this a working office and not a french beach

jim,what are you doing here did you come back for us or
michael,i cant finish i feel so weak i just
jim,well youre probably dehydrated

jim,wow you are a downer we were having a pretty nice day
pam,im still having a nice day

pam,yeah but theres other better people out there who are helping
michael,you just dont think i am capable of making a difference
pam,i know you michael i saw you naked
michael,you dont you dont know me youve just seen my penis i can make a difference remember im the one who started this whole thing off by hitting meredith with my car and i owe it to her to finish this gd 5k gets up groaning jim tries to help no no
michael,finishing that 5k was the hardest thing i have ever had to do i ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water than i have in my entire life people always talk about triumphs of the human spirit well today i had a triumph of the human body thats why everybody was applauding for me at the end my guts and my heart and while i eventually puked my guts out i never puked my heart out and im very very proud of that
meredith,hey michael
michael,hey mer how ya doing
meredith,better
michael,its ironic isnt it i mean im in the hospital for not getting enough water and youre in it for a disease that causes the fear of water
meredith,im in because you hit me with your car but i wanted to say i heard you were trying really hard so im not mad at you anymore
michael,thanks im not mad at you anymore sighs takes sucker out of his mouth wanna share

andy,so hows the view old girl  looking out windows  oh  theres a cemetery  you think thats affiliated with the hospital or is it a like a separate feature
michael,hey okay okay okay    you can just close that
angela,bye meredith  here you go  we got you some balloons

michael,on the one hand its a relief to know that its not just me the whole office is cursed  on the other hand i may have to deal with the dark unknown
dwight,question has anyone recently offended a gypsy
michael,we have to have done something wrong
stanley,you ran over an employee
michael,that was the curse stanley and we are trying to find the cause of the curse
dwight,mmm  nods
michael,oscar are you santaria
oscar,i was raised catholic but im agnostic now so i guess im a secular humanist
michael,oh  great  we have a secular humanist here that is disgusting
oscar,michael do you know what secular humanism is
michael,yes  it is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition
oscar,oh
michael,stupid

toby,technically hes right
michael,hey shut up toby look why do we as a society hate old people so much

michael,ryan thinks that technology is the answer well guess what i just drove my car into a lake
oscar,you did what
michael,i drove my car into a bleep lake why you may ask did i do this well because of a machine a machine told me to drive into a lake and i did it i did it because i trusted ryans precious technology and look where it got me

michael,exactly
phyllis,did you get any clients back
michael,maybe maybe not time will tell but i will tell you one thing those gift baskets never endangered anybodys lives looks at ryan game set match point scott game over end of game

michael,i think i know whats going on  ryan believes that there is some sort of special boss water that he gets to drink now  and there isnt  but um dont tell him  dont tell him that  i dont want to jeopardize our friendship
michael,ryan is causing some problems  and you were always good at handling him  what should i do to control him
kelly,well hes superticklish i dont know if that helps
michael,i know i know no what something else
kelly,oh hes also superinsecure about his height

kelly,and he doesnt care about anybody but himself
michael,good
kelly,and dont have sex with him cause if you do the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time
michael,my generations all about hard work and accomplishment  like the moon landing  or vietnam  rolling stones  greatest band ever
oscar,youre fortythree  mick jaggers like sixtyfive
michael,and still rockin oscar  one of the greatest alltime oldies was a little oriental guy named confucius  he literally invented the ancient chinese secret  heres some of his quotes  confucius say man who farts in church must sit in his own pew  confucius say man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day  confucius also say virgin like balloon  one prick all gone
oscar,did you google confucius and just print out the first thing you saw

jan,sighs whistles michael please would you not email while were having lunch
michael,im not  its solitaire  see

michael,mmhmm
pam,jan called and asked where youre going to meet for dinner  she wants you to call her
michael,im a little busy right now  could you blackberry me a message

jim,you didnt set up your blackberry dwight

jim,as opposed to
dwight,printing press  tractor  mechanical thresher  telephone  airplane  the only inventions that matter
jim,what about cars
dwight,they fall under the category of airplanes
jim,they do  so cars are flightless airplanes
dwight,correct
jim,got it  theyre like the penguins of the airplane family
dwight,thats an excellent analogy
jim,thanks
pam,hey dwight what about vaccines
dwight,scoffs vaccines are for chumps
dwight,my mom didnt believe in vaccines  i got my smallpox the oldfashioned way  and i survived  so jokes on you hospitals
michael,creed is using the toaster as a mirror and touching up his hair with a sharpie and a comb the one advantage to being older is that i know a few things about a few things and i am young enough to not forget them  and old enough to know the difference between the two  i am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws but young enough to date college girls  but old enough to know better  im at a perfect age  i could die now  but i wont because i am young
creed,sup rolls into kitchen on a skateboard

creed,suit yourself  but if it were me botox points at oscar wig points at kevin
kevin,wha
michael,and the same thing goes for quarterly reports  they are unreadable  theyre just numbers and boring and blech  so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic like if we have a bad quarter put in a storm cloud and when we have a good quarter fireworks or a racecar everyone groans doesnt have to be a racecar  use your imagination
jim,theres this cube on the screen and it bounces around all day and sometimes it looks like its heading right into the corner of the screen and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away  and we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner  pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room okay  i believe she thinks she saw it
pam,i saw it  i saw it and it was amazing  who said i didnt see it  did jim say that i didnt see it i saw it
michael,we have a lot of colored paper here why oh why do we keep printing this on white screen saver box hits the wall

michael,sighs walks back into office
kevin,oh no its bad  its real bad  its like eating a hot circle of garbage

pizza guy,shrugs
michael,sarcastic shrugging of shoulders what do you mean hmmum

michael,ive never done this before ive never quit anything in my life  so you are filming history
michael,nick i had a dream last night that i had two full time jobs  one here at the lipophedrazone diet pill company
mr figaro,lipophedrine
michael,and the other i was a regional manager of a small paper supply company called dunder mifflin
mr figaro,never heard of it
michael,in this dream i did both of these jobs beautifully and i loved it and everybody loved me  but the truth is i cant do this
mr figaro,are you quitting
michael,i am
mr figaro,come back anytime dont forget to disinfect your headset
michael,i was never in this for the money  but it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me  i tried to live the dream  i tried to have a job a girlfriend another job and i failed  but the good thing about the american dream is that you can just go to sleep and try it all again the next night
andy,so
pam,whats up
andy,me  all night  dreaming about angelas smoking hot body
pam,youre being gross
andy,not from a male perspective  you need to set me up with her i know she told you that shes looking and shes totally not responding to my moves
pam,what moves
andy,i have moonwalked past accounting like ten times
pam,i cant believe thats not working
andy,yeah
pam,um i dont know if i really see you two together
andy,really  well maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain
pam,shes very religious
andy,okay well i come from a line wasps so long it leads back to moses
pam,okay well she takes her convictions pretty seriously she can be kind of severe
andy,yeah and i punched a hole in a wall
pam,thats right you did
andy,yeah
pam,now that i think about it angela and andy might actually make a good couple  but i couldnt do that to dwight or angela or andy
michael,hey kevin youre a gambler right  a rounder you play the ponies small horses
kevin,i do gamble michael
michael,yeah i was thinking about doing some gambling myself  you know just a little bit of money  maybe doubling it and them doubling it seven more times  i dont know kind of just for fun  i was thinking do you have tips or ideas about sure things  like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight you know like like hes tied into some crooked dealings maybe his kid is sick or something  like who do i call about that
kevin,the mob
michael,do you know anybody in the mob
kevin,shakes head no
michael,okay um oscar im going to need to take another advance on my salary
kelly,what do you mean you have plans tonight
darryl,i have my daughter tonight were renting charlottes web
kelly,well you have to make a choice its either your daughter or me
darryl,my daughter
kelly,okay i see how it is pushes a stack of files onto the floor oops
darryl,that was cold
kelly,makes a w then an l with her fingers and then runs a finger across her throat
phyllis,hes always been terrible with money
stanley,i bet its jan spending him straight to the poor house
kevin,yeah women be shoppin
meredith,i cant believe he has a second job
oscar,hes not even good at his first one
michael,hey guys
kevin,shh
michael,whatcha talking about  camera pans to each face in the break room  okay i know whats going on  youre talking about jim and pam if theyre having sex what it looks like i know i think
pam,michael
michael,hey hey hey
oscar,michael are you having money problems
michael,monkey problem no im not having monkey problems  why would i have monkey problems
oscar,you heard me correctly
michael,oh i hate monkeys
pam,whats going on why do you have a second job
michael,i dont have a second job  maybe im having an affair with suzanne summers
pam,doesnt jan have money
michael,i dont talk to my girlfriend about money  it is rude and unsexual
kevin,true its best to hide our money problems from women
michael,i totally agree with you  but i dont have money problems i dont  alright you know what  watch this if i had money problems would i do this michael holds up a bill crumples it up puts it back in his pocket
oscar,you just put it back in your pocket
michael,yeah but i destroyed it its not even useable anymore
darryl,hey lets call this what it is
darryl,its like she only wants to hook up when ryan comes around  its gotten to the point where i get excited every time i see that little dude walk through the door
kelly,well i just need to know where this is going
darryl,hey i like you  oh yeah whats not to like  but you need to access your uncrazy side otherwise maybe this things run its course
kelly,dont you dare walk away from me darryl philben you are the most selfish person ive ever met in my entire
darryl,slow down think it over
kelly,darryl philben is the most complicated man that ive ever met  i mean who says exactly what theyre thinking  what kind of game is that
creed,hey cuz heard youre having money problems
michael,no you didnt
creed,listen ive got the answer  you declare bankruptcy all your problems go away
creed,creed bratton has never declared bankruptcy  when creed bratton gets in trouble he transfers his debt to william charles schneider
michael,how would that help creed  in monopoly when you go bankrupt you lose
creed,you dont go by monopoly man that game is nuts  nobody just picks up get out of jail free cards those things cost thousands
michael,that is a good point
creed,bankruptcy michael is natures doover  its a fresh start its a clean slate
michael,like the witness protection program
creed,exactly
oscar,not at all
michael,ive always wanted to be in the witness protection program  fresh start no debts no baggage  ive already got my name picked out lord rupert everton  im a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs  thats the life
michael,i declare bankruptcy
oscar,hey i just wanted you to know that you cant just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen
michael,i didnt say it i declared it
oscar,still thats not anything
oscar,this is a lot of credit card debt
michael,yeah tell me about it
oscar,mmm
michael,you know jan has my credit cards and shes using them as if im made of money she thinks im a human atm machine
oscar,okay a hundred and twentyfive dollars amazon
michael,oh thats the muppet show on dvd classic
oscar,twelve hundred dollars  whats a core blaster extreme
michael,that is by far the best way to strengthen your core  this machine you sit on a stabilizer ball you put your feet into the power stirups you reach up and you grab onto the super rod and you twist and you twist and you twist  it strengthens your entire core  your back core your arm core the marine core actually uses it  i think thats how they got a core
andy,i left a little present for angela  i think shes going to like it because i found it outside of vance refrigeration all alone and i told her in the note that the cat came to find her that they were destined to be together  i got game
oscar,okay the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need like a car and a house
michael,mmhm  that is so cool how you have my name at the top
oscar,the red bar is what you spend on nonessentials like magazines entertainment things like that
michael,right
oscar,this scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever ever needs like multiple magic sets professional bass fishing equipment
michael,how do they do this so fast  is this powerpoint
pam,man angela really had a hold on him dwight playing the recorder in the background  angela
oscar,michael im going to set you and jan up with a debt consolidator you meet with this guy

jim,the dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings
pam,table making never seemed so possible
jim,you will never want to leave your room
pam,the architecture reminds one of a quaint tuscan beet farm
dwight,im glad you enjoyed your stay

michael,these are our accountants and as you can see they are very different sizes what you might want to do is kind of a papa bear mama bear baby bear thing that might be kind of fun
kevin,looking at oscar mama bear
michael,who else
jim,i think its great that the companys making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us i mean when i tell people that i work at dunder mifflin they think that we sell mufflers or muffins or mittens or and frankly all of those sound better than paper so i let it slide
jim,you playing that game again
dwight,second life is not a game it is a multiuser virtual environment it doesnt have points or scores it doesnt have winners or losers
jim,oh it has losers
dwight,i signed up for second life about a year ago back then my life was so great that i literally wanted a second one in my second life i was also a paper salesman and i was also named dwight absolutely everything was the same except i could fly shot of dwights avatar flying around
michael,reading off piece of paper little girl in a field holding a flower we zoom back to find that shes in the desert and the field is an oasis zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the worlds largest resort hotel zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the worlds largest prison  but we zoom back further
ad guy 1,okay i can tell that your time is valuable
michael,actually i dont get paid by the hour anymore but thank you i get paid by the year so
ad guy 1,that all sounds really really ambitious
michael,yeah i know
ad guy 1,why dont we show you what we did with the nashua branch
michael,mmm okay commercial plays on laptop peppy music in background
michael,thats what nassau came up with that sucks chuckles whoa
ad guy 1,thats what we came up with
michael,well we can do better than that
ad guy 1,well the main part of the ad has to stay the same actually
ad guy 1,yeah its the last five seconds where we have some leeway
michael,the waving
ad guy 1,well no no you dont have to be waving that was just what they did you guys can be clapping sitting standing outside inside whatever this is where you really get to be creative
andy,i need some advice ive been spending a lot of time making out with angela lately but weve been necking but only necking  right not actually kissing our mouths just the neck on neck its just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together its hot im not going to lie to you  but its a little weird but you seem like a guy with answers so how do i fast track this to get to first base
dwight,we cannot talk about this because someone might hear us
andy,well use code names
dwight,angela can stay the same but well change andy to dwight
andy,thats not different enough
dwight,dwike
receptionist,you have a call from eddie murphy
ryan,hello

ryan,what
michael,okay calm down i have a small problem
ryan,i told you not to call about small problems
michael,yeah well when i call about big problems you dont like that either so make up you mind kiddo here is the deal the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box and sort of ignoring my ideas
ryan,thats good theyre creative youre not
michael,im creative ryan
ryan,its not part of your job its like maybe you can cook but it doesnt mean you should start a restaurant
michael,well actually i cant cook and i am starting a restaurant mikes cereal shack im thinking well have as many varieties as you can buy in the store
ryan,okay im not really interested in that right now im delegating creativity to creative professionals its a different skills set look i wasnt good at sales right
michael,yeah
ryan,but im good at managing people who do sales
michael,are you i dont think youre doing such a good job here suppressing ideas and creativity
michael,all right let me ask you this tell me if you think this is creative when i was five i imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn and this is before i had even heard of one or seen one i just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows and had a huge spike in its head and i was five five years old couldnt even talk yet
michael,hey guys um you know what we cannot shoot this ad today
ad guy 1,okay when should we come back
michael,how about never hundred hours sir
ad guy 1,we were sent here to help out
ad guy 1,okay im not going to argue with this guy lets go good luck dude

phyllis,okay

michaels ad,chariots of fire theme plays it all starts with an idea but you can never tell where an idea will end up people passing a corporate memo around to each other because ideas spread they change grow they connect us with the world kelly catches paper airplane that says i love you and in a fast moving world where good news moves at the speed of time newspaper with andy saying hometown boy wins race and bad news isnt always what it seems dwight hands phyllis paper that says you have a son and its me because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance stanley finds paper that says turn your life around now hiring at dunder mifflin to score jim throws paper in basket michael retrieves it it says worlds most creative boss dunder mifflin limitless paper in a paperless world

michael,there are no bad ideas but for an idea that was really really bad
toby,i spent three years in advertising before i came here

michael,hey everybody i just got off the phone with david wallace and he has given us the goahead to make the first ever dunder mifflin television commercial  huh
everyone,applause
michael,i cant hear you less applause  heard you a little bit less that time  must be
dwight,we had already applauded
michael,okay okay  who could do music
pam,how about darryl
michael,actually im a little concerned about having a black person do the music because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a celestine prophesy and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano
jim,michael is on a mission to prove that hes creative  which i think is odd because michael actually might be the most creative person ive ever known  every day michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before
rolando,on phone dunder mifflin this is rolando  oh yes shes been expecting your call knocks on door
karen,yeah
rolando,karen  hes on line one
karen,thanks ro  hey we finally connected  hows scranton
karen,i am the regional manager of dundermifflin utica branch  turns out its a pretty easy gig when your boss isnt an idiot and your boyfriends not in love with somebody else
karen,look all im saying is it would be a great opportunity and wed love to have you come aboard  so think about it okay  okay bye
karen,look for the record a certain scranton salesman approached me okay
michael,this is perfect
dwight,he looks like your twin
michael,this is a dummy a la ferris buellers day off  we have tied a string to the wrist which goes to the door  when somebody opens the door the hand goes down hits the remote turns on the tape recorder which is me snoring  now nobody knows whether i am here or whether i am gone
dwight,i will know

stanley,i dont understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here
michael,just go out and come back in
stanley,i got an offer from utica for more money and im going to take it
michael,what
michael,hey everyone can i have your attention please  i just thought you all should know that stanley hudson is planning on leaving us because our old friend karen from utica is going to give him more money to work there
all,applause
michael,no no no no nono no no  you completely misinterpreted my tone this is a horrible thing  clearly karen is trying to get back at us because jim dumped her
jim,oh i dont think that is whats happening
michael,okay smarty pants then why  why is she trying to take stanley from us
stanley,i think its because of my sales record
michael,that could not possibly be it
michael,you cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office  stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary  the bluesy wisdom the sassy remarks the crossword puzzles the smile those big watery red eyes  i dont know how george bush did it when colin powell left and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley they have another thing coming
michael,how can i get you to stay
stanley,money
michael,yeah we all want money  but there is none in the budget so tell me why youre really leaving

michael,a bunch of guys in a tent making smores makes a noise and gestures with his hands
jim,whats that
michael,hello im broken mountain you know heres the thing thats not how you go camping i think you go camping by yourself

jim,i thought we had that looked at
michael,im sick of it jim im sick of this place
michael,when jan and i had satellite we used to watch a reality show called survivorman and it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die try not to get eaten by an animal or be overexposed
michael,ok i will only need two things roll of duct tape and a knife
dwight,winks im on it leaves room
michael,ok thirty minutes or less please come back save the receipts dwight comes back with set of knives hey what
dwight,lets see if any of these will work clears the front of michaels desk
michael,hey hey hey dwight dwight rolls out an assortment knives dwight
dwight,i keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office i saved jims life with a can of pepper spray i had velcroed under my desk people say oh its dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place well i say its better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally than by a stranger on purpose
michael,dwight and i are going out he will return later but i will not i will also be taking a personal day tomorrow and perhaps the next day
pam,do you want me to ask where youre going
michael,no

jim,ok great
michael,this is a very personal private experience in the wild that i wish to share it with me myself and i
jim,yup
michael,when i return i hope to be a completely changed human being
jim,thatd be great
dwight,do i believe that michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment lets put it this way no i do not
michael,this is what a true survivor man does you simulate a disaster like a plane wreck you could only wear the clothes that you have on and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets now in this case this disaster is a serial killer creepy guy whos abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead
dwight,no i would never leave you for dead you would never escape
michael,well yes i would and i would survive
dwight,i would make sure that you were dead
michael,well
dwight,first i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified

jan,michael just relax okay
donna,you know i think theyre uh ready for us now so
michael,okay all right
deposition reporter,mr scott do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
michael,yessh
lester,mr scott can you describe the circumstances of ms levinsons termination
michael,well it was not just termination it was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior
lester,oh very good well put
jan,people underestimate michael there are plenty of things that he is well above average at like ice skating he is a very good ice skater
pam,hey kevin jim needs to see you
kevin,about what
pam,he needs help balancing some travel receipts
kevin,are you sure he wants me because i have oscar balance my travel receipts

lester,how long have you known the plaintiff
michael,i havent actually seen it but i have seen the firm and i am planning on renting the pelican brief
lester,how long have you known ms levinson
michael,six years and two months
lester,and you were directly under her the entire time
michael,thats what she said
lester,excuse me
michael,thats what she said
lester,ms levinson told you she was your direct superior
michael,uh whwhy would she say that
jan,can we just move on to another question
donna,no wait i dont understand whos on record on saying this
lester,with all due respect im in the middle of a line of questioning now mr scott what did you say ms levinson said regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position
michael,come again thats what she said i dont know what youre talking about
jan,okay if i may he was just telling a joke before so can we move on to another question
lester,oh are you sure
jan,uh yes
lester,can you go back to where this digression began
deposition reporter,reading off paper mr schneider and you were directly under her the entire time mr scott thats what she said
michael,well delivery is all wrong shes butchering it
kelly,pam leaving bathroom kelly entering awkward moment pam steps aside to let kelly in yeah thats what i thought
lester,did ms levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired
michael,she thought it had to do with the twins thats what i call them
lester,can you be more specific who are the twins
michael,um to be delicate they hang off miladys chest they make milk
lester,you dont need to go any further her breasts
michael,yes
lester,she thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery
michael,yes and frankly the timing was nothing short of predominant
lester,what about your romantic relationship with ms levinson could that have played a part in her termination
michael,well if it did then the company is breaking its own rules
lester,interesting how so
michael,because before we started dating we disclosed our relationship to hr and i have the proof right here makes a gasping sound
donna,okay the company has just a few clarifying questions mr scott if thats okay with you
michael,i will allow it
donna,um would you mind please just uh taking a quick look at uh this photograph please diane hands michael the photo of jan and michael in jamaica
michael,uh
donna,that is you and ms levinson in jamaica is that correct
michael,uhhuh
donna,and that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship does that sound right mr scott the timeline here is actually very important please when did your relationship actually begin
michael,ugh well dedepends on how you define begin i mean if it was from the first time we shook hands thats like six years ago if its from the first time we kissed thats like two years ago
donna,wait excuse me
michael,if it was the first time we kissed sober it was like four months after that
lester,could we take a short break
donna,no uh are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in february as you previously testified to here
michael,line
donna,im sorry what
jan,he asked for a line like in a play
deposition reporter,reading off paper mr scott do you realize you just contradicted yourself i did yes you did can i go to the bathroom no i really have to ive been drinking lots of water you went five minutes ago that wasnt to go to the bathroom that was to get out of a question you still have to answer it first can i go to the bathroom no
jim,good game meredith
meredith,dont patronize me
dwight,all right what is going on here
jim,dwight thank god youre here as it turns out one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master and i have to play him tomorrow or we lose the account can you help me out will you help me practice
jim,dwight and jim are playing pingpong and dwight scores what the hell
dwight,i told you
dwight,all of my heroes are table tennis players zoran primorac janove waldner wang tao jörg roßkopf  and of course ashraf helmi i even have a life size poster of hugo hoyama on my wall and the first time i left pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of andrzej grubba
michael,jan and i had an off again on again relationship for two years and i know this destroys her case and i am sorry but i throw myself at the mercy of the deposition
diane kelly,thank you mr scott thats all we needed to know
lester,wait wed like to enter to the record a page from michael scotts personal journal
michael,whoa whoa whoa whoa what are you doing with my diary
lester,this is plaintiffs exhibit 107 i quote from an entry dated janruary 4 of this past year just got back from jamaica tan almost everywhere jan almost everywhere hehe oh diary what a week i had sex with my boss i dont know if its going to go anywhere jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere that it was a one time mistake but we had sex six times so you tell me i am definitely feeling very eerie
michael,irie
lester,irie sorry more tomorrow xoxo michael it would appear that neither you nor ms levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word is that correct
diane kelly,were gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed
michael,i dont think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary
diane kelly,its basic discovery we have the right to review it
jan,ok lets make ten copies of this diary
toby,um can you make it eleven
jan,eleven sure and well break for lunch so everyone can have a look
michael,looking for a place to sit goes to tobys table can i sit here
toby,nods you know i uh i know a little about what youre going through in a way um when i was a kid my parents got divorced they both wanted custody and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court so i dont know i didnt want them getting divorced in the first place you know i loved them both so much i just wanted michael pushes tobys food tray off the table and walks off
michael,how can you give up my diary like that
jan,i had to im sorry but i need to win this we need to win this
michael,howd you even find it
jan,you keep it under my side of the mattress
michael,i dont like lump im really upset about this
jan,alright i stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer you emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company lets call it even
michael,fine i love you
jan,i love you too
diane kelly,looking at a copy of michaels diary mr scott who is this other woman ryan who you refer to her as just as hot as jan but in a different way
michael,not a woman just a cool great looking best friend
lester,arent we trying to determine whether michael or jan were engaged in a romantic affair not michael and this ryan person
toby,laughs out loud excuse me
michael,alright alright this is the way i see it yes i had sex with jan and yes i did consider jan to be my girlfriend however jan clearly didnt consider me to be her boyfriend so her actions are completely rightful
diane kelly,ok mr scott its its admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you
michael,thank you very much you didnt have to say that
diane kelly,considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews
michael,that was before our relationship she was going through a divorce and she was drinking a lot jan glares at michael of water
diane kelly,mr scott this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review would you mind uh reading the date on that please slides the performance review towards michael
michael,march 17th
diane kelly,and that would be a month after your relationship became official is that correct
michael,yes
diane kelly,you may read the uh highlighted portion out loud if youd like to
michael,reading the performance review i am out of carrots i am out of sticks mr scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee and a poor branch manager i recommend he be removed from that position and reassigned to sales where he belongs
diane kelly,mr scott after hearing that wouldnt you say ms levinsons judgment is at least very seriously flawed
michael,stares at diane eyes tearing up
diane kelly,mr scott
pam,walks in the conference room where jim and dwight are playing pingpong hows it going
dwight,well he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable
jim,check this out though spin serve serves and dwight scores well it works like 80 of the time so
pam,nice so should i reschedule the rematch with darryl now
jim,i think im ready
pam,ill make the call
dwight,wait a minute darryl is the client no no no he works here dumbass
jim,right spinserve serves and dwight scores
michael,how can you do that to me
jan,looks at lester
lester,you can respond just remember its all going into the record
jan,michael i am not the enemy ok dunder mifflin is the enemy
michael,dunder mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect with loyalty they were going to give me your job and i should have taken it
jan,alright wait before you go any further let me show you what kind of loyalty they have ok lester please read that part of wallaces deposition
lester,starting at paragraph 6 council mr wallace regarding michael scott was he a contender to replace jan levinson david wallace yes
michael,see i was his number 1 contender i was being groomed
lester,council was he your first choice david wallace michael scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years
council,was he in the top 5 of contenders david wallace what do you want me to say come on hes a nice guy there were many people that i considered council was he seriously being considered for the corporate job david wallace no
lester,i have one more question mr scott wouldnt you agree with ms levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees
michael,absolutely not
pam,watches jim score in pingpong against darryl yes way to go looks at kelly see that
kelly,yeah the floppy haired girl you date won a point
darryl,19 serving 4 serves and scores

michael,nods and shakes hands with david wallace hey david
david,yeah
michael,i think youre a nice guy too
david,thanks michael
michael,why did i do it i dont know jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary but she already brought the diary with her to new york so you expect to get screwed by your company but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend
michael,driving with jan in the car what do you want to do for dinner

dwight,michaels dinner party is for couples only which is why i wasnt initially invited  but that was then  i very recently entered into a serious monogamous relationship  looking around if that idiot ever gets here
jan,so this girl that i basically grew up with becomes miss west virginia and then suddenly all the boys start paying attention to me  and it was funny because you know i never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me  you know jan wow you are so much more beautiful than miss west virginia  laughs  ah so that is why i uh wait pam what was your what was your question

michael,so shes passed out and some kids spraypaint a swear word on the neighbors dog
jan,yeah
michael,and the neighbors blamed jan
jan,yeah  but you know it was my fault
michael,its like you know the dog shouldnt have been outside in the first place  anyway its a tragedy really because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds
jan,mmhmm
michael,so
jan,yeah
michael,well
jan,it was me
jim,whats that
jan,i spraypainted that dog  it was sleek and shiny and perfect little haircut it was parading around like it was gods gift to this godforsaken town laughs and i just couldnt take it anymore so i went over there and i held down my knee and i just spraypainted it until i was good and done claps  it bit me on the arm reaches out and taps jim i didnt even feel it

kevin,off screen hurts like hell
pam,to michael who is looking at a chair catalog did you pick a new chair its been awhile
michael,pam when i first opened this catalog i thought i was just going to be picking out a chair
pam,but instead you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair
pam,michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago and normally i wouldnt care but he promised me his old one its way better its one of these makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as pam slumps down i really want it

pam,the one in the really great mesh black highback swivel chair
michael,look at her smile those eyes look at her eyes shes got  i dont know what it is actually she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch
pam,or in a great chair
michael,oh yeah maybe but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women
pam,i definitely remember your dinner party
michael,i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman whispers jan i think that fate put this catalog in my hands
pam,actually i put the catalog in your hands cause you have to pick out a new chair
michael,what is it like being single i like it i like starting each day with a sense of possibility and im optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results

stanley,oh for the love of god
michael,you just do and i dont know why so please help me understand
stanley,fine here it is you are a person i do not respect the things you say your actions your methods and style everything you would do i would do it the opposite way
michael,well stanley maybe youre feeling that you dont respect me because you dont know me very well
stanley,michael i have known you a very long time and the more ive gotten to know you the less ive come to respect you any other theories
michael,all right you dont respect me i accept that but listen to me you cant talk to me that way in this office you just cant i am your boss cant allow it

stanley,has potential to be your best idea yet michael smiles
phyllis,thats the dumbest thing i ever heard laughs
michael,dammit phyllis alright everybody out except phyllis
michael,you know i dont care what he did to me  hes mean to other people thats what gets me  hes just
jim,who else is he mean to

jim,hey
michael,i know i know  i think its tiny  i think its too small if anything  and that your glasses make you look ugly
jim,shes never worn these glasses before
michael,well hes just mean
pam,michael i think that what stanley did to you was rude  maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly
michael,its complicated pam  i mean the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk
jim,well i actually agree with her i think you should talk to him  and you also might want to explain to andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash
kelly,oh yeah and then yell at creed because you know what  looking can be as bad as touching
michael,okay
michael,i put stanley on a pedestal for a long time  but sometimes he can just be a big fat jerk  i jerks dont deserve to be on pedestals  jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are  big marble jerk stand

jim,productivity  my numbers are good
toby,i know um but ryan thinks that uh theyre not good enough
ryan,wallace likes jim  so going after him  thats a risky move for me but in business you gotta take risks  sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway with the top down pushes button about eight times to get the top down  finally it comes down and its all bunched up  as hes fixing it the car rolls backwards a bit

jim,nice they bump fists
ryan,ok elephant in the room  lets talk about it  do i regret what i did  of course i do  even though it was an amazing ride and ill give you an example  anyone see survivor season six dwight raises his hand anyone know joanna on that show dwight nods in new york city i hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that  indistinguishable so
michael,clapping ok  well done  good speech ryan youre a good guy
holly,lets start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning  it is wrong to make personal calls during work hours now some of you marked that you very strongly agree  but ideally you would have selected totally agree
phyllis,i thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree
holly,corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement
michael,well i think we can all totally agree that holly is totally fantastic claps
holly,thank you  in fact spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing
kelly,what
holly,yes its called time theft and its the same as taking money from the company  can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters
stanley,this meeting
andy,heyoh
dwight,yes
michael,to holly cant set em up like that
kelly,why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time  if i want to go outside and hang out once an hour then ill just take up smoking  ill do it  i dont care
meredith,ill smoke with you  i got a bag of cigars in my purse
holly,stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about
michael,can we have a moment  whispering can i talk to you for a sec  lot of good stuff and you look you look fantastic
dwight,michael
michael,yeah
dwight,what should we be working on while you guys are talking
michael,do some do some work whispering to holly people expect a lot from these meetings  laughter sudden twists  surprise endings  you need to be robin williams and m night shyamalan  you need to be robin shyamalan
holly,well i just have to get through the binder
michael,do you just youre kind of losing them
holly,i am
michael,yeah dont think about the stakes  itll freak you out
holly,ok to everyone michael makes a really good point so uh lets just open this up a little bit say my name is lauren and here i am shopping in a supermarket and i steal a pencil  thats not right
michael,coughs to hide his words lauren coughs enough with the pencils
holly,no i have to go over pencils and office supplies  its part of the ethics thing
oscar,that isnt ethics  ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good  this is just the corporate antishoplifting rules
andy,ill drop an ethics bomb on you  would you steal bread to feed your family  boom
oscar,exactly andy
andy,yeah i took intro to philosophy twice  no big deal
dwight,its a trick question  the bread is poisoned  also its not your real family  youve been cuckolded by a stronger smarter male
andy,no thats not how it works
michael,i would not steal the bread  and i would not let my family go hungry
holly,ok but we should get back to business  have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace
michael,anybody  this is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions  stanley  oscar come on
oscar,pass
michael,i will go first  when i discovered youtube i didnt work for five days  i did nothing  i viewed cookie monster sings chocolate rain about a thousand times
holly,what was the dilemma
michael,to tell you or not  and im glad i did  i feel very very good  cathartic  i promise you that you are not going to get into trouble  you can say anything you want with total and complete immunity
holly,oh no no no
michael,yeah interrupting gibberish  come on anybody  let it fly
oscar,ok once in a while ill take a long lunch
michael,a siesta
dwight,time thief  time thief  fire him
jim,dwight youve really never stolen any company time

meredith,exchange of steak  have you ever had sirloin steak honey
michael,thats crazy  thats crazy talk  meredith  the merenator sleepin with suppliers  hooooh  wow  what time we got checks watch you know what  thats a good place to end it  right there  this i think was a great ethics seminar  she has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about  right what is wrong  whos to say  really  in the end  i mean because it is unknowable  but lets give her a round of applause  holly everybody  holly  get back to work everyone applauds then leaves to holly great job  i am truly impressed  that uh you really pulled that one out  classic  classic meeting  we should celebrate
holly,michael there is some serious issues with meredith
michael,oh
holly,i mean all of you have done things i wouldnt have done myself but merediths actions are really over the line
michael,nnyeah  what ya gonna do
holly,so regarding this supplier approximately how many liaisons have there been
meredith,liaisons you mean meetups  i dont know once a month for six years  something like that
michael,meredith why dont you tell holly its not what she thinks  nothing unethical happened and that you just like to sleep around
meredith,am i in trouble here or something
michael,no no this is just a stupid formality
holly,no its not a formality  now were these um meetups just personal  unrelated to business
meredith,nah i wouldnt have done it if it wasnt for the discount paper  theres not a lot of fruit in those looms
michael,ughh  for the love of god were trying to help you stupid bag
holly,what i dont understand is why the steak coupons  i mean if you were already getting the discounted paper
meredith,well its funny  maybe its a girl thing but after we did it and he would give me those coupons i just felt good about myself holly begins to write in her notebook hey whats going on here  i thought i had immunity
holly,well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace  i mean ive never heard of anyone whos kept their job after something like this
meredith,well im not quitting
jim,starts a stopwatch as dwight yawns stops it when dwight is done yawn  four seconds
dwight,what are you doing
jim,oh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so im just making sure
dwight,oh so wait a minute youre going to time me every time i yawn  thats absurd jim smiles and starts the stopwatch really in a mocking voice oh hey look monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody  hes ti dwight conceeds and goes back to work jim stops the watch
jim,personal conversation  seventeen seconds

michael,here too  you know what my favorite season is
holly,maybe we should talk about meredith first
michael,yeah get the boring stuff out of the way  autumn was what i was going to say  when the leaves change  its just i i think it is the most contemplative of seasons
holly,ok so i have gone over this and i have thought about it and i just dont think there is any way i can write a report that doesnt end with her being terminated
michael,wow terminator terminator
holly,im from da future
michael,yeah
jim,hey andy
andy,yo

andy,is that anything like the original battlestar galactica
jim,you know its weird  its practically a shot for shot remake
andy,really dwight closes his eyes clutches the paper in his hands huh thats cool
jim,storys kinda bland  its about this guy named dumbledore calrissian who needs to return the ring back to mordor
andy,really  that doesnt sound right
michael,i just dont want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance  i mean what sort of place is that to call home  and meredith needs this job  this is her main source of money
holly,well thats very sweet but we have to follow the protocol  those are the rules
michael,ok new idea  we dont report it at all  we just punish her
holly,we punish her
michael,mmhmm tell her she cant have sex for six months
holly,i dont think we could enforce that
michael,i dont know  i saw this thing like a belt with a key
holly,a chastity belt
michael,no its more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of sometimes they are made of metal  you know what i am talking about  you unlock a little door that down where you where you put where you put the
jim,he has not stopped working for a second  at 1245 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open which i always thought was impossible  at 132 he peed and i know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports  and on the flip side i have been so busy watching him that i havent even started work  its exhausting being this vigilant  ill probably have to go home early today
michael,i am just saying that i dont think that you understand what i am saying
holly,no you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet accept the discount on supplies not fire meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened
michael,yes
holly,what am i saying
michael,well bleh busted  i dont
holly,im saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and i dont think i want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated
michael,well you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family
holly,its not a family  its a workplace
michael,i will be honest with you  that car ride did not go well and that was not my fault  the only reason i am standing out here right now is because i dont want to take the elevator with her  and i am holding on to her leftovers throws hollys leftovers in the trash
jim,dwight walks back to his desk 19 minutes and 48 seconds  what were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds
dwight,none of your business
jim,so i guess i can assume that was personal
dwight,dwight stares at angela buttoning the top button of her blouse fine
jim,so maybe youre not completely ethical after all
dwight,yes maybe im not dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera
holly,its been a little tense  people are suspicious of me  and my best friend in the office wont even talk to me turns out being the morality police does not make you popular  i should know because in middle school i was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker  i was just hoping middle school was over
ryan,kendall from corporate hr is on line one and holly is on her way in too
michael,whats the only thing worse than one hr rep
ryan,two hr reps
michael,you get me
holly,can i sit
michael,i dont know  can you  kendall my main man
kendall,on speakerphone listen holly michael i just got the report that your branch submitted and theres a lot of stuff about a relationship meredith is having with
holly,yes that came out during the ethics seminar
michael,let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar
kendall,well im not sure these circumstances warrant any action
holly,oh i think it is pretty clear that it was unethical
kendall,well from what i can gather it seems like a gray area  look to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and i dont know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that
holly,umm kendall i understand that the discount is good for the company but im just not happy about the way we are getting it
kendall,i thought it was clear with you holly  your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training
holly,no i understand
kendall,every other branch has managed to get this to us so if its not something you can handle then thats a different discussion
holly,no  i can do it
kendall,good
michael,how do you tell somebody that you care about deeply i told you so  gently with a rose  in a funny way like its a hilarious joke  or do you just let it go because saying it would just make things worse  probably the funny way
holly,can i have everyones attention  excuse me may i have everyones attention please  we need to finish the ethics seminar
andy,no way lady
kevin,its a trap
holly,everyone please i just need your signatures to show corporate that i gave you the training
meredith,dont sign anything
michael,ok everybody listen up  if you are not in that conference room in two minutes i am going to kill you
stanley,its a quarter to five and i have started to gather my things
michael,get in there right now or im gonna lose it everyone gets up to go in the conference room
meredith,am i getting fired
michael,now is really not the time meredith
holly,in this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days  sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers  personal days on the other hand are much more flexible
phyllis,thank you meredith this was delicious
meredith,hey where is the steak sauce
kevin,i think were out
meredith,i got some in my minivan somewhere
andy,wait a second how does the steak factor in again
kevin,i think she got it as a tip but i dont know why she didnt just take cash
phyllis,i dont care what shes doing  i just hope she keeps doing it
stanley,amen  just keep the ribs coming
holly,stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about
oscar,thats a big ethical area
oscar,listen i would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics  why isnt the company doing better  mmm it could be the pad of postits i took home last week  or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the ceo for a year of substandard performance  im sure well cover both in the seminar
creed,ive done some things im not proud of  committed some atrocities in vietnam uh two years ago  princess cruise lines
phyllis,during our honeymoon safari in africa bob and i were driving late at night and hed been drinking and suddenly thump  we hit something with our jeep  it was probably a man  we didnt know what to do  we heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us so we just kept driving as fast as we could  we bribed the airline got on a plane that night and fled home  maybe it was just an ostrich  in a soccer uniform
holly,have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place
michael,lets keep this rollin ryan
jim,oh but you mean other than embezzling
ryan,fraud jim fraud
jim,fraud
ryan,sure last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and i just peeled out my z3 and i knocked the mirror off somebodys car  i never said a thing
kevin,wait what
kevin,you knocked the mirror off of my car
ryan,yeah isnt that messed up
kevin,yeah
ryan,that guy did a lot of things im not proud of
kevin,wait when you say that guy you mean you
ryan,i mean the guy i used to be  im ryan 20 and if it makes you feel any better that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too tries to walk away
kevin,no you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you too
ryan,look i feel you okay  that guy took no responsibility for his actions
kevin,but are are you gonna pay for my mirror
ryan,if i have to answer for everything that guy did shakes head im never gonna move on
kevin,it was like two hundred dollars
ryan,were never going to get what need from that guy still shaking head pats kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen
ryan,hey anybody see a pair of sunglasses
kevin,umm i think i saw some in the kitchen toaster oven bell rings ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he sees his melted sunglasses on the tray ryan takes cooked sunglasses to kevin oh i didnt do that  that was kevin 10 but he hurt a lot of people ryan and i cant accept responsibility for what he did ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash kevin smiles
meredith,what are we gonna do
stanley,about what
meredith,holly  shes on the warpath  she is gunning for all our jobs  do you guys have any dirt on her
phyllis,mmm sometimes her stockings have a run in them
meredith,no  something i can blackmail her with
phyllis,one time i said good morning to her and she didnt say it back

holly,good
michael,um listen  jan levinson is coming in today and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy  the child of which i have a vested interest  its all kind of weird  anyway she is incredibly fat and enormous right now  extremely unattractive  and you are on the other hand one of the more attractive people in the office  so while shes here i am going to be acting kind of cold to you  and i am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings  and im treating ryan the same way
holly,of course yeah
stanley,i do not like pregnant women in my workspace  theyre always complaining  i have varicose veins too  i have swollen ankles im constantly hungry  do you think my nipples dont get sore too  do you think i dont need to know the fastest way to the hospital
jim,jan enters the office pushing a stroller jan
jan,hi jim
jim,what do we have here
jan,this is my baby
jim,really
dwight,oh no michael enters and notices jans baby

michael,so this is astird
jan,astrid
michael,oh ok  why didnt you call me
jan,well um you know labor just kind of started very suddenly and
michael,i could have helped

jan,ok you dont have any idea what ive been through so lets
michael,no i dont
jan,im sorry i thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet
michael,can i hold her
jan,yes yes you can you know i think just leave her in the car seat yeah
michael,cradling the car seat awkwardly all right ok
michael,i love babies i think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways  i try to pick up and hold a baby every day if possible because it nourishes me  it feeds my soul  babies are drawn to me and i think its because they see me as one of them  but cooler and with my life put together a little bit  if a baby were president there would be no taxes there would be no war  there would be no government and things could get terrible  it actually probably  it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion
michael,carrying the car seat ladies and gentlemen it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office assst
jan,trid
michael,trid levinson  hi  astrid this is everybody look  this is your family  youre going to know them for the rest of your life

dwight,heaving the stroller into a tire yard dont hit the fence  oh no my child

pam,jims in scranton
alex,i know but all im saying is if theres even a teeny tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist then i think you should stay here because you dont want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been and that is the end of my speech i planned it all anyway   i will see you tomorrow

jim,we should take a look at those surveys
michael,why are surveys important okay hypothetical a man wants to buy 500 reams ofcarrots and so hes like what do i do where do i go do i go to the insensitive carrot supplier the insensitive carrot salesman or do i go to the nice carrot salesman who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot but guarantee nextday delivery on your carrots most companies need their carrots the next day now substitute paper for carrots and that is why surveys are important

oscar,thats the original
michael,pam would you stand up for a sec sits in pams chair hmm see how relaxed i am i like this chair slowly sinking into the chair offers good support it is urkelnomically correct its a good chair i think were spoiled because we dont appreciate the things that we have you think kids in africa have chairs no they sit in big piles of garbage you think they have copiers  the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where michael is not visible over the desk they dont have copiers they dont even struggles to get up from pams chair gah they dont even have paper and we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it my point i this i have seen the light in terms of what we need and it is nothing

jim,wait what
pam,you can do that
kevin,hey michael whats 394 times 5912

michael,david here it is my philosophy is basically this and this is something that i live by and i always have and i always will dont ever for any reason do anything to anyone for any reason ever no matter what no matter where or who or who you are with or or where you are going or or where youve been ever for any reason whatsoever
michael,sometimes ill start a sentence and i dont even know where its going i just hope i find it along the way like an improv conversation an improversation
michael,this is going to sound sort of highmaintenance but could we have it like three degrees cooler in here i always think better when its cooler

dwight,your fictitious name
michael,michael scarn
dwight,i am a paper salesman looking for a new job i find out everything about their expenses and salaries
michael,okay
dwight,then we meet at the dennys
michael,interrupting no
dwight,and then we compare notes
michael,no no i never said dennys ihop
dwight,no arguing over each other
dwight,you know how i feel about ihop
michael,oh dont start
dwight,are you socialist
michael,you know what i dont want to get into this debate again i enjoy ihop
dwight,ill have a cup of a coffee
michael,you will have pancakes and youll like it
dwight,store only has three employees
michael,so what
dwight,it means they are not expanding
michael,maybe they are shrinking
dwight,no
michael,they could be shrinking
dwight,no because their sign is centered perfectly above their store no sign of the sign being moved
michael,ah ha popping something in his mouth yup
dwight,spying through binoculars its lunch time and no sign of anyone coming in or out which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch
michael,mm hmm
dwight,which means theyre not acquiring new business so once again no growth
michael,and there are clouds there are clouds in the sky which means gonna rain bad for business
dwight,oh it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus
michael,argh why are you all
dwight,get your clouds right
michael,shut up
dwight,so you go in now i am going to go in exactly ten minutes we have never met each other we are complete strangers also we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger lick ur lips try it michael licks lips no no like this dwight starts and michael follows passionately licking their lips good
michael,ready to do this
dwight,yeah
michael,good here come the sharks they imitate jaws theme sounds and dwight makes shark fin on his forehead
michael,in nature there is something called a food chain its where the shark eats a little shark and the little shark eats a littler shark and so on and so on until you get down to the single cell shark so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business
michael,hello
intern,hello hi
michael,my name is michael scarn i am a local business owner and i would like to find out about your company
prince grandfather,oh please come in
michael,thank you
prince grandfather,what kind of business are you in
michael,we are a law firm
prince grandfather,i assume your primary paper needs are stationary general office
michael,you know i will be honest with you about something where we used to live our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and i just didnt feel like a priority so i guess my question reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it for you would be reading off sheet how many clients do you have
prince grandfather,about 80
michael,really that many this doesnt seem like a very big operation
prince grandfather,its just me my wife and my son
michael,ah so when did you set up shop
prince grandfather,i opened this place after i came back from vietnam
michael,oh vietnam i hear its lovely
prince grandfather,muted mmhmm shrugs
andy,each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments topic hillary swank is attractive
intern,hot
kevin,the debate is whether she is hot
stanley,what difference does it make attractive beautiful hot were talking about the same thing here
kevin,huge difference a painting can be beautiful but i dont want to bang a painting
andy,okay tmi
michael,so even specialty paper say 94 brightness doublebonded you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock
prince grandfather,you sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer
michael,well that is because i am a genius
prince grandfather,oh really
michael,yes well about some things and other things i am very stupid like watch this is this the cup picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion is this the cup picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion is this what i drink out of glug noise both laugh laughter is my job tears are my game law is my profession
dwight,hello i would like to apply for a job

michael,try 80
dwight,pshaw thats nothing ive 90 clients myself you had better look out someone might run you out of business
prince grandfather,i sure hope not
dwight,me too smirking
jim,i think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures you know we dont really see them as real so therefore we dont judge them as real people
kevin,are you serious jim just show us a picture
oscar,kevin cmon
kelly,yeah shut up kevin
kevin,hes making all these fancy uh its a gut thing
jim,kevin you know what why dont you close your eyes imagine that hilary swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you in a more and more seductive voice and says kevin malone i just read your online profile and there is nothing i would rather do then make out with you right now and now you tell me something is she hot kevin gets up to join the hot team to their great joy does that end the debate
kevin,kevin sits down gets right back up and heads back to not hot team no its is she hot not would you do her respect the game
angela,oh my god
jim,fingers opened an inch this close
brandon,grandfather so why are you considering leaving dunder mifflin

michael,dont blow it hey linda can i get a picture of you
linda,you want a picture of me

prince grandfather,8
michael,excellent way to go nice michael and granddaughter prince exchange high fives
prince grandfather,dont put that granddaughter prince erases and corrects answer
kevin,ladies and gentlemen even though the penis was fake i was expecting a second plot twist where we found out hilary swank was a boy
pam,disapprovingly kevin

david wallace,you could have burned down the whole building
dwight,i just want to say for the record i did not kill anyone  stanley was attacked by his own heart and he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days
lawyer,did you shout fire causing a panic
dwight,yes i shouted fire  i shouted many things i also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what heeded
michael,hed hedded

david,look this is very serious offense  we have cause to fire you
michael,can you shove down  instead shove down please  instead what i think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer

michael,and we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice  something that dwight doesnt like
dwight,peta
david wallace,michael you have to take responsibility here one of your employees had a heart attack  he could have died because of the way that you are allowing your office to run  do you want that on your conscious
michael,do you
david wallace,michael

michael,yes
dwight,come on
michael,im a smart guy  ill figure it out
dwight,thats preposterous

cpr trainer,abc okay  and hat stands for airway breathing and circulation
michael,okay you know what that could be a little confusing because in sales abc means always be closing
dwight,this is a farce i should be teaching this course
michael,shut it  shut it
michael,we found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his when his heart went berserk and i knew exactly what to do but in a much more real sense i had no idea what to do  so i thought we should have cpr training class and of course you cant get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it red cross you know racket
kevin,giving chest compressions to the practice dummy i cant keep doing this forever
cpr trainer,its been 20 seconds
kevin,call it
cpr trainer,would you like to try next
dwight,absolutely i would not
michael,you know who i really think should go stanley
stanley,oh i dont know
phyllis,thats not a good idea michael
michael,come on
phyllis,he needs to rest
michael,no rest for the sick we are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working  what are you gonna do if youre by yourself and your heart stops
stanley,i would die
michael,and youre okay with that
stanley,im okay with the logic of it
michael,uhuh  no no no  come on get up  lets do this
stanley,yes i had a heart attack  i would quit but im too old to find another job and i dont have enough saved to retire  i feel like im working in my own casket
michael,come on stanley  youre losing you  youre losing you do it

mose,no thats not part of it
michael,where are they  you know what if we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them i mean what kind of quality of life do we have there
kevin,i would want to live with no legs
michael,how about no arms no arms or legs is basically how you exist right now kevin you dont do anything
mose,all right well lets get back to it cause youre losing him okay too fast everyone we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute
michael,okay thats uh hard to keep track  how many is that per hour
jim,hows that gonna help you

jim,right
mose,okay well a good trick is to pump to the tune of staying alive by the bee gees  do you know that song

michael,yes
david,was it jim
michael,no
david,ok was it dwight
michael,long pause yes
michael,dwight walks in come on in good to see ya have a seat i just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea
dwight,that was your idea
michael,woah wow who told you that
dwight,you did several times over and over again
michael,same time as dwight no i dont think i ever did that was your idea dwight
dwight,same time as michael you were dressed as willy wonka so
michael,im not taking im not taking
dwight,wasnt my idea loved  but i cant
michael,wait a second wait a second i wrote it down in my diary
dwight,you dont keep a diary
michael,yes i do youve just never seen it reading from diary march 4th dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets
dwight,hold that thought dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns flipping through diary march 4th michael scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year
michael,why do you have a diary
dwight,to keep secrets from my computer
michael,ok you know what you came up with this idea i remember you told me that you loved the willy wonka movie when you were growing up
dwight,impossible
michael,yes you did
dwight,i wasnt given candy as a child so a movie that fetishized it that much would have made no sense to me plus we werent allowed to see movies so do the math
michael,what are you writing dwight writes in diary
dwight,had conversation with michael about taking credit for an idea that wasnt mine discussed movies
michael,would you like to go to lunch with me just the two of us
dwight,with all my heart
kevin,you guys are throwing a lot at me
jim,all im saying is that its a first dates so just keep a respectful distance
kevin,right
pam,i dont think jim means to say that you shouldnt touch her
jim,no that is what i mean
pam,to jim shush to kevin kevin a playful touch on the arm or on the back it can show your interest and its really romantic
kevin,puts hand on jims hand like that
jim,no stop it
andy,dont touch her dont talk to her dont look at her
andy,jim andy and pam all talking over each other turn into this black and carbon brickwhere this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that
michael,we think a lot alike sometimes you will think something and i will say what youre thinking
dwight,ok what am i thinking right now
michael,umm nacho chips
dwight,no how skin is the largest organ of the body
michael,oh ok let me just cut to the chase dwight i want you to fall on your sword for me
dwight,oh not gonna happen
dwight,i did fall on my sword once i was running with it in my belt wont happen again
michael,why do you even want to stay at dunder mifflin i mean whats the point youre cooped up in there all day you dont get to do your farming youre not dating angela anymore it doesnt matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea it doesnt matter me on the other hand i would be lost without this place you way too manly
dwight,what about shoe la la
michael,sighs its not ready yet
michael,i have an idea for a fancy mens shoe store called shoe la la and its just mens shoes for the special occasions in a mans life like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby or for just lounging around the house
michael,may i have your attention please i have an announcement mr dwight schrute and i just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although i probably will never do it again i had fun i really had fun with my best friend dwight
oscar,these arent announcements
michael,yes they are you just dont care about the information
dwight,i love working here and i do not want to leave
michael,he doesnt love it that much wouldnt be such a bad thing for him to be fired
dwight,well
michael,i mean like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion
dwight,we discussed the fact that im cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world
michael,right
dwight,no plowing my own acres going around shirtless all day you know experiencing freedom
michael,thats it thats it you cant put a price on freedom
dwight,try me
michael,thats why you made the decision thats why you made
dwight,i havent made a decision yet
michael,you kind of have
dwight,no
michael,yes

charles,jim knocks on door come in
jim,hey
charles,hey
jim,alright charles ive gotta be honest i think we really got off on the wrong foot here and truth be told im a pretty smart guy and uh a hardworker  and a great number two for the office
charles,number two
jim,secondincommand to michael
charles,oh i didnt know that position existed
jim,oh thats because at first it was a made up position for dwight just to make him feel better assistant to the regional manager but then he lost that and michael gave it to me
charles,so youre the assistant to the regional manager
jim,assistant regional manager yeah
charles,any responsibilities come with it

david,michael listen
michael,do you talk to him about this youve talked to him all day obviously did you talk to him about this
david,well i didnt know about the figs specifically
michael,ok then i dont get it it doesnt make any sense to me because i thought in the new system i was supposed to talk to charles and then charles was supposed to talk to you and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again
david,thats not exactly
michael,clearly thats what you wanted
david,no
michael,fifteen years i have been here and i have sacrificed a lot

michael,i dont understand that after fifteen years of service here i have to get in the car and drive to new york in order to talk to you  that doesnt seem right to me that doesnt seem fair and i think that ive earned more than that
david,yeah youre right yes i get it i get it michael heres what im going to do
michael,ok
david,we will move some money around and i will personally see to it that you have your party you have your figs i will be in attendance its gonna be great hows that

dwight,i barge because i care april 13th 2002 that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased
mr schofield,maybe we should schedule a meeting on our
dwight,la la la continuing  notice my persistence and recall continuing you called dunder mifflin and your order was filled within an hour
michael,im going to pull a date out of the air right now april 13th 2002 that is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs is it not we all know that the economy is bad and bloated companies like dunder mifflin
dwight,come on
michael,are going to fall by the wayside two of their branches have closed within the last year the michael scott paper company however has opened a new branch this very month
dwight,what hes not telling you is that he will abandon you

dwight,how is tom the homosexual sophomore
michael,i wanted to start a company not a war because in a war you always fight those you are closest to and the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother for what what purpose did that serve apart from abolishing slavery in that case war was the right choice this doesnt feel as important though thats just how the world works i guess
michael,he gives me leads and i take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good and if a friend cant make you feel good then i dont want any friends except dwight because he is our only source of fertile leads

andy,who is that knocking on my taste buds why its mr lemon hmmm nice to meet you
pam,its good but wont it feel weird cutting into a cross

charles,why are you telling me this
andy,i just think the bar should be lower for a newbie
charles,is this something you really want to have said
andy,i dont want to have said that  but i think its important that you know it
charles,i dont know what to do to inspire these people okay maybe its my fault

financial guy,your prices are too low
michael,lowest in town
financial guy,why do you think staples and dunder mifflin cant match your prices
pam,corporate greed
ryan,look our price model is fine i reviewed the numbers myself  over time with enough volume we become profitable
financial guy,yeah with a fixed cost pricing model thats correct
ryan,yeah
financial guy,but you need to use a variable cost pricing model
michael,okay sure right so why dont you explain what that is to so that they can under just explain what that is
ryan,explain what you think that is
financial guy,okay
michael,explain that
financial guy,as you sell more paper and your company grows so will your costs for example delivery man health care
michael,well we dont
financial guy,business expansion
michael,whatever yeah
financial guy,at these prices the more paper you sell the less money youll make
michael,our prices are the only thing keeping us in business

pam,he can only keep one of us as a salesperson now  hell make his decision by the end of the day
ryan,i think you should get it  you really grew into it
pam,oh  i think you should get it  youve changed a lot and youd be good at it

michael,i dont think you are being totally impartial though because you havent said one bad thing about pam
jim,and i wont

michael,okay how about a woman pam
pam,oh i cant do lunch i was just sending you an email jim and i need to leave early today to meet with our contractor
michael,oh really ok
pam,just sent it
michael,what about the rest of you complete silence
michael,at dundermifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and i dont know who instituted it i think it started right after my predecessor stepped down but at the michael scott paper company i really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday so rules be damned i wanna have lunch with these people
michael,who else who else ryan
ryan,i dont do lunch im eating five small meals a day now
ryan,now that im back to doing the job of a temp again i find that food is one thing i can control

dwight,attention office who here is planning a trip to youngstown ohio i will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something this location is the superior court
pam,so someone is going to a court big deal
dwight,it is a big deal cause theres only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in ohio and not be charged with a crime to claim an inheritance from a deceased relative to obtain a learners permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15 erin let me see your birth certificate
erin,sure
jim,there are other reasons to go to ohio
pam,were getting married today
jim,so it turns out its the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period
pam,tell em how it happened

angela,no we heard that about jim
michael,jim no no i spread the rumor that somebody here was a j crew model and i was referring to myself
angela,how is that a bad rumor

oscar,michael why why say all these things why make up an eating disorder stanleys affair me being a spokesdog
stanley,pissed off you told everyone i was having an affair

michael,to jim and pam how long have you known about the pregnancy
jim pam michael and dwight,look at each other uncertainly
michael,a week a month a year
jim,michael we only told our parents last week
michael,did you pee on a stick

michael,phone rings hits speaker button
erin,michael teri hudson returning your call
michael,gasps
pam,in disbelief you called stanleys wife
michael,oh oh yeah a long time ago just to make sure she was out of town oh oh god
jim,dont take it
michael,no i have to take it or itll seem suspicious
pam,if you talk to her youre gonna tell her about stanley and thats gonna seem more suspicious
michael,no no i can do this
jim,you cant do this
michael,yes i can i am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo and i need her help we will haggle about money and then i will back down and then i wont talk to her until this whole cynthia thing has blown over
jim,that sounds terrible
pam,michael please dont
michael,picking up phone hey what up cynthia lowers phone looking terrified
jim,gets up to leave room michael gestures for him to stay
michael,hold on a second cynthia
jim,hangs up michaels phone leaves room
michael,well it turns out that teri was already suspicious because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago so stanley promised that he would stop and he did end of story well not exactly camera pans down from michaels office window to parking lot below stanley is seen destroying michaels sebring with a crowbar uhh cynthia kept calling him she would not stop calling him and she was in love with him oh and get this cynthia also married so you cant stop love i guess jim is seen displaying fetus picture on his desk as pam smiles and quite frankly i dont think you should ever try
maurie,talking head with eric and megan i learned that a company can describe their internship as full of exciting experiences even if thats a lie theres no regulation
megan,i learned that half these peoples email password is password
erin,i learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets
megan,i thought it was 500
erin,oh i guess i didnt learn anything

creed,yeah that makes way more sense   okay thanks boss
michael,what is jim telling him  that i cant handle this job  that s bull crap  that is bull crap  although it has been chaotic lately  corporate shut down the buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients  i will tell you there has been work everyday  had to come in on a saturday to retrieve i left my cell phone here
pam,hey kelly
kelly,ugh so jealous of your boobs
pam,thank you  um listen i just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to the wedding which is totally understandable and more than fine
kelly,is ryan going
pam,i dont know he hasnt rsvpd yet
pam,we invited everyone in the office to our wedding  even though we realized most people wouldnt be able to make the drive to niagara falls  whispers which is why were having it in niagara falls  normal volume then michael told everyone they could have friday and monday  off if they came  so now people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work
kelly,heres the deal  i really want to go but im not gonna go if ryan doesnt go because its kind of a waste of time  that came out wrong  it would awesome if you could try to get him to go because id really like to be there to support jim
andy,what can i do for ya hoss
michael,staring into the conference room how are your sales doin
andy,how are my sales doin  busted  my numbers are down a little bit and its cause of the economy  youre not buying it youre good  okay the truth is i have been having trouble focusing lately  im in this weird flirty nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and its a total mind effer
phyllis,again with the cousin
andy,oh im sorry phyllis you explain this email okay   hey andy lets go visit grandma and then get drunk together ha ha
michael,shhh im just trying to figure out whats going on in that room okay
michael,wallace had to show up on the one four month period that im completely overwhelmed
michael,you know when they say its so crazy it just might work  well i dont believe that  i say go for the airtight plan and that is why i am having andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart  it is just elegant
michael,in the cheese cart be my eyes
andy,you got it
stanley,what have we here
andy,oh just backing up and turning around
kevin,hey were gonna do this
andy,dit dit dit dit its not for you enters the conference room  pardon moi messieurs  i took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which i will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room
david,cheese platter
andy,oui oui monsieur  from the wisconsin region a nice firm cheddar  also from the great state of wisconsin an aged parmesan  here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which i think youll  find both challenging and delicious  at that point i would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of illinois where you will find this fine bleu cheese dressing  if i may be so bold its a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese  bon appetit
david,alright well i should go  thanks for this  youve given me a lot to think about  please promise me you wont do anything until we speak
jim,no i wont   alright thanks for giving me your time  i appreciate it
david,thank you jim
david,erin is michael around

michael,crawls out of the cheese cart unseen hey hey you must have walked right past me  how you doin
david,ah yeah could we talk in your office for a second
michael,yes definitely
toby,spying at darryls house sounds like a emdp40
dwight,nah thats a ge a p40 is much higher pitched
toby,youre into trains
dwight,i have been my whole life
toby,wow
dwight,im rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house
toby,thats so cool
dwight,yeah
toby,wow id love to take a look at that
dwight,yeah its just a run of the mill slaughter house but sure anytime

toby,you gonna eat all that dog food yourself
dwight,ooohhh crashes car into garbage cans  oh man  you okay
toby,just keep going
pam,hey ryan
ryan,hey
pam,so i just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to my wedding
ryan,yeah i might stop by
pam,it costs about $75 per person
ryan,okay i once had a glass of cognac that cost $77
pam,can you just tell me now if youre coming or not
ryan,yes im coming to your wedding
pam,okay ryan howard yes
ryan,probably yes
pam,kelly kapoor yes
david,are you sure youre okay with these new responsibilites
michael,look who youre talking to
david,im just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyones talents
michael,well i would say that my greatest talent is being the best man woman or child to have ever run this branch ever
david,what about jim  do you think jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position
michael,looks at jim   permission to speak on the record
david,please do
michael,jim is like big bird  he is tall and yellow and very nice  but would i put him in charge  no i dont think so  because big bird doesnt make the tough decisions  i if i was gonna put someone in charge i would put burt in charge or i would put one of the real grownups in charge like maria or gordon maybe
david,i thought you liked jim
michael,very much jim is my best friend but its his performance report right here  now this was written by toby who we all know is extremely reliable
				david,reading performance report  constant office distractions spends way too much time at reception antagonizes other salesman not at all what he thinks he is
michael,its not very well written but you get the gist
david,is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch
michael,i can just continue to run it myself
david,jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then jim would be promoted to your position
michael,this was jims idea
david,mmhmm
michael,wow  ummm well id have to talk to my mother and my guy at h and r block
david,ummm okay heres the thing though  the plan doesnt work unless we have someone to replace you  i was hoping plus we have to worry about jim he has another job offer  we may have to replace him
jim,i didnt tell michael because i thought hed try to help  example he handed out jello shots at the 23rd mile of the steamtown marathon
david,jim can you walk me out to my car for a second
jim,sure
michael,after talking to david jim looks dejected i cant help but feel partially responsible
michael,shakes jelly beans little pick me up  jim accepts oh those are the best  little sugar rush
jim,when you were in the office earlier talking to wallace did i come up at all
michael,well we did talk about how handsome you are
jim,why dont we head in your office to talk
michael,oh what a week god  we said i know there were certain things we said
jim,michael look ill just be honest with you  earlier today i spoke with wallace about a promotion  i actually think that talk went really well  and then after he spoke with you for some reason it felt like things had changed
michael,hmmm thats weird thats weird its kinda weirding me out  did you know that lincolns secretary was named kennedy
jim,michael did you say anything
michael,tell you what when you leave this office i am going to call wallace and i am going to tell him that you should get that promotion
jim,really
michael,yes
jim,you will  wanna do it right now
michael,yes
jim,i tried to keep michael in the dark  i should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark
dwight,i need to see your pupils   i need to see if theyre dilated
toby,if they were dilated
darryl,toby dwight  is that them
gwenneth,definitely
darryl,you come to my house bust up my trash cans call my baby sister an ass and told her to eat dog food
dwight,we thought that she was you
darryl,why would you think a lady is me
dwight,are you are you serious  be cause you look exactly alike  am i the only one  are you getting this
toby,no nah  i dont see it
darryl,heres what im gonna do im calling corporate and im filing a complaint against both of you
dwight,aww darryl
darryl,cmon gwenneth
gwenneth,sad
david,on phone this is david
michael,hey david this is michael scott  jim pushes speaker phone button  michael scott here
david,yep
michael,just wanted to talk to you about  jim halpert  i understand that he did not receive the promotion  and i wanted to see what i could do to nudge you in the right direction
david,so what youre changing your mind about jim
michael,absolutely turns speakerphone off not turns speakerphone back on  like i said before jim is fantastic and he deserves this job
david,michael it seems like youre cutting in and out this is not what you said earlier
michael,wha heres the thing jim is the best man for this job i think you should give it to him
david,well it doesnt change what you showed me in jims file
michael,well nnnn that that was an anomaly  that file had been falsified  toby flenderson is doing drugs
david,michael i really dont know whats going on police sirens in background down there but oh dammit i am getting pulled over for talking on my cell dammit
toby,hey darryl look ahhh were here to apologize ahh
darryl,cool
dwight,wait  theyre using the lift as their own personal elevator
toby,what
dwight,he broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment case closed
darryl,stupidest thing ive ever heard
dwight,really  then why is there new wood only on one railing  hmmm   we should check the security tapes toby
toby,well i dont think theres any reason to check em but i suppose if we wanted to be really certain
darryl,alright yeah fine so whatever
dwight,yes
toby,you really did it
dwight,now i would like to file an official complaint to corporate because darryl lied on an official form
darryl,and im telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister
dwight,phhhht  no judge is gonna believe that
toby,ahhh kay  look we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork but you know we can just move on with our with our lives
toby,so dwight and darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now i get to do all this paperwork  we worked it out
michael,hey hey jim it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face  alright  just do it
jim,how many times have i asked you to put me up for a branch manager job
michael,i never recommended you because i didnt want to lose you and i didnt want to lose pam starts to choke up and now i dont wanna lose the baby
jim,so instead you screwed me
michael,thats what she

david,hey guys so i spoke to alan we had kind of an unconventional idea which i think is pretty cool  but it only works if everyones on board
michael,well just as long as it means jim becomes a manager
david,we were thinking of having two branch managers in scranton  both of you guys working as comanagers  jim would handle the day to day and michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff
jim,wow that sounds pretty cool
michael,i like that so manager and comanager
david,comanager and comanager  see there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way i can sell it upstairs
michael,well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager
david,alright hey michael can you pick up for one second  michael picks up phone okay look im not going to force you into anything  if youre willing to lose jim fine you just say so and well find another solution okay  is that what you want to do

jim,i have noticed that we
michael,welcome
jim,thank you ive noticed weve been having a lot of conference room meetings
michael,mmhmm
jim,and im wondering if perhaps those are a bit um
michael,disruptive
jim,yes
michael,no i dont think they are i think the meetings are very important
jim,okay maybe we should talk specifics
michael,lets do
jim,okay yesterday we had a meeting about planets
michael,n well to be fair jim james jimothy to be fair jimothy the ah that sounds weird are you okay with being called jim
jim,i am
michael,alright jim to be fair the conversation wasnt about planets
jim,right
michael,at first we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon so you draw a line from there to the other planets and i think by the end we all learned a little bit about how small we are
jim,yes i agree
michael,because its a big universe and were all just little tiny specks of dust
jim,i just think that maybe theyre eating large amounts of the day
michael,you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps you go to sleep its light out you wake up its dark thats the whole day where did that day go i have no idea
jim,you mean on a weekend
michael,yes
jim,how about this i think our goal should be we dont have meetings unless theyre absolutely essential
michael,alright no more meetings this week
jim,really you just agreed to that
michael,i can be very suprising
phyllis,whats going on
pam,i need to fit into my wedding dress however im also pregnant
ryan,you know its a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy look at these actresses some of them lose weight
phyllis,hey did you guys register for wedding gifts
pam,we did but mostly because people expect us to were also accepting other gifts not on the registry however much
pam,its awkward asking people for money but we could really use it why doesnt crate  barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash
phyllis,perfect i hate registries
pam,oh good
phyllis,my cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes i know i shouldnt tell you but youll still be suprised when you see it youre not registered for a birdhouse are you
pam,no were not
phyllis,good good
michael,mmhmm
jim,walks in sees oscar stanley creed and kelly sitting in michaels office okay i thought i saw people missing
michael,yeah just focusgrouping a product expansion idea to these folks got one of each
jim,really hey stanley what was the last thing michael said before i came through the door
michael,stanley you dont need to answer that
jim,stanley
stanley,if you dont smell this youre fired
jim,okay michael i thought we agreed to not take up peoples time with meetings like these
michael,what do you mean by these people
jim,michael this is a conference room meeting
michael,oh hey everybody i think that jim has gone insane because he thinks that my office is a conference room
jim,thats not what i meant
michael,listen jim no offense but when push comes to shove what i want is more important that what you want
jim,i disagree
michael,what do you guys think all start talking at the same time
jim,great guys can i just have a moment alone with michael
michael,no no no you dont need to go anywhere anything that jim has to say to me he can say in front of these types of people
jim,that is not what i said and also i am comanager meaning you are not the only manager anymore i am also i comanager
michael,that is not what wallace told us
jim,thats exactly what wallace told us
michael,that is not the way i heard it
kelly,i love rivalries michael or jim paris or nicole heidi or lc its so much fun but i guess if im really thinking about it and answering your question honestly id have to go with lc  heidis a bad friend and her skin is terrible
michael,it is one thing me giving you the comanager title it is another thing you bossing me around
jim,im not bossing you around im trying to do my job which is sharing your job so maybe we should just call david wallace
michael,no no no no we will not call david wallace michael pulls out his cell phone i will call david wallace
erin,david wallace is on line two for you guys
michael,or david wallace will call us on line two why dont we just
jim,hey david you got jim here
michael,hey david this is michael senior comanager
david wallace,hey guys um im calling because unfortunately we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year and i know people expect it however there just is only a small amount of money for each branch so were leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it
michael,got it dave sounds like your classice bigpicture decision
jim,which will clearly affect the daytoday wellbeing of our employees
david wallace,its probably a little of both
michael,which is it more of
david wallace,excuse me
jim,david i know that im very new at this but i have a very good perspective on how things work
david wallace,wait im sorry michael are you are you texting me
michael,i thought maybe we could talk after this is over
david wallace,look i need you both to take care of this this is not going to be a problem is it
jim,nope not at all
michael,no it will not be i am on top of it
david wallace,very good
jim,alright thanks alot david
michael,talk to you later jim hangs up okay you didnt let me say goodbye sighs and claps hands once alright i am looking forward to this
jim,you dont have to lie
michael,i hate the fact that we have to do this together i think we work better separately when i am irritated and i look at you i dont see you anymore
jim,right
michael,all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are
jim,alright lets get started
creed,hey why havent we ever um
meredith,we have
michael,you know theres no easy way to do this i say we add 15 to their paychecks and dont say anything about it
jim,do you mean like breakin in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll
michael,no we can do it during the day it doesnt have to be that dramatic jim
jim,okay you know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options
michael,jim dont take this the wrong way are you gonna take this the wrong way
jim,its hard to tell so far
michael,you use your brain too much
jim,im sorry are you advocating that i use it less
michael,sometimes the smartest people dont think at all
jim,you just came up with that
michael,as i was saying it
jim,yeah okay so for the 15 increase pro everyone gets a little bit
michael,in nerdy voice con you look like a nerd
jim,con no one gets as much as they did last year
michael,pro you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds
jim,pro no favoritism
michael,con you unzip your pants and you find that theres a calculator down there
jim,ive been studying michael for years and ive condensed what ive learned into this chart pulls out a pie chart how michael spends his time as you can see we have procrastinating and distracting others and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking i made it bigger so that you could see it
kevin,hey pam i heard that you were registered but i didnt hear where
pam,i dont think we registered anywhere we just want cash
kevin,like money like you you want my money
pam,mmhmm
kevin,will you take a check
pam,yeah
kevin,cool in the memo line im gonna write to loves eternal glory
pam,okay
kevin,wait til monday
pam,is this what ive become materialistic shallow i feel horrible looks down at the check oh look mrs pam halpert thats the first time ive seen it in writing
jim,you know the more i think about it the more i think we should give it to the salesmen
michael,that will not go over well
jim,i know i just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now course i know that this might come off as biased so you know what let us
michael,oh my god are you gonna make another pro and con list im gonna kill myself
jim,im not gonna let you stop me from thinking
michael,no i could not do that jim i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect if i can just think this through if i could just think it exactly right i can make this perfect and then i can go down every avenue and every avenue off of that avenue and then another avenue
jim,michael
michael,and then another
jim,look you have a lot of strengths
michael,oh i do tell me what they are
jim,i think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well
michael,ha that i am not known for that
jim,but there is a reason why im here
michael,yes you went over my head to wallace
jim,no its because you also have a lot of weaknesses michael
michael,okay well why dont you tell me what those are jim why dont you enliven me
jim,i dont think youre good at making tough decisions
michael,ah
jim,at thinking out the options and then stating that decision very clearly especially when its an unpopular decision
michael,okay heres a tough decision for you you suck you suck is that clear enough for you
jim,but maybe im here for a reason because i might have some good ideas too ive been sitting out there and ive been learning a lot and maybe i can just bring something different to the table
michael,okay skippy here we go why dont you run yourself out there and tell them laughs you call it
jim,leave the conference room to address everyone
michael,to the camera this had better be terrible
jim,could i have everyones attention please i have some tough news so im just gonna give it to you straight truth is we only have so much money for raises this year so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people wont now what weve decided is we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff
meredith,wait seriously
jim,look you guys are smart so im just leveling with you im just trying to treat you like adults
oscar,thank you jim for thinking that were smart people
angela,but i do not understand if were such smart adults then why dont we get raises
oscar,excellent question genius its because jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with
jim,ooh easy thats not it at all
oscar,well
jim,really what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the office
kelly,walks in from shopping with bags in her hands whats going on
kevin,jim is only giving raises to the salesmen
kelly,what the hell why are you being such a jerk
oscar,hold on kelly would it help you to know that jim thinks youre smart
kelly,no puts down her bags how is that gonna repair ryans car
dwight,this is ridiculous how could he do this to us
jim,okay dwight you know what youd be getting the raise so
dwight,what about all these people huh how is it fair to them
oscar,exactly
kevin,totally
oscar,we work just as hard as the sales people we deserve raises
creed,yes
angela,yes they dont get em if we dont get em
meredith,my kid needs shoes you want to tell him he doesnt get shoes
kevin,yeah
dwight,her kid needs shoes jim
meredith,what the hell everyone complaining at jim
jim,wow im just gonna rewind and back off a bit so imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles michael comes over by jim laughing
michael,that was good that was good okay all right well we all know its hard to be a boss right you know what look around you these are your best friends these are the people who will open their hearts to you they all have heartons for you someone growns in disgust and that is a gift so in terms of gifts we should be giving each other gifts angela yes lend oscar a cup of sugar this
angela,what are you talking about michael
stanley,we just need to hear your plan for our raise
michael,my plan a man panama
andy,thats not how that goes
meredith,youre not saying anything at least jim was being direct
jim,thank you meredith
meredith,when he was telling us his dumbass plan
oscar,we would just like to know whats happening are we getting a raise yes or no
michael,alright let me get this clear does everybody want a raise all say yes alright everyone wants a raise so what were going to do is go into here and we will not come out until we do
oscar,again that gives us no information
phyllis,this isnt a game you know its our livelihood
michael,what about a raise based on merit
jim,rank each person individually
michael,mmhmm piece of cake ryan obviously the best
jim,sarcastically well obviously too bad hes a temp and doesnt count so lets get started starts to write on a piece of paper
michael,are you making a
jim,nope im numbering the paper
oscar,everyone talking to the camera just
kevin,yeah i dont understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us
angela,its not like were not gonna see the checks were in accounting
meredith,i am so pissed at this company
dwight,out the side of his mouth and jim
meredith,yeah who said that
dwight,i think it was creed
creed,yep
jim,to camera its going really well actually
jim,to camera holds up a bean each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise we each got 24 beans so the idea is you place the bean on the picture walking around the table of who you think deserv whos that picture that michael drew of toby looks like a monster
michael,toby
jim,hes not a part of this you know that
michael,just wanted to draw a picture of him
jim,okay your move
michael,alright who to pick walking around the table who to pick
jim,here we go
michael,i will skip a turn
jim,okay youre gonna still have to play that bean you know that
michael,i need more time
erin,wallace sent an email about a meeting next week he wants you both to respond michael and jim leave dwight sneaks in
dwight,people are starting to notice how terrible jim is its great eventually theyll rise up and revolt my only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later if the people here were our founding fathers the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years because stanley washington was napping and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly
dwight,come on in everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table   thats right come in feast your eyes they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces
oscar,what the hell
dwight,things were not this bad when just michael was manager
michael,hey what are you guys doing in here
kevin,what does a bean mean
pam,why arent there any beans on this very old frizzyhaired picture of me
kevin,michael what does a bean mean
pam,jim
jim,i was just trying to be unbiased
kevin,what does a bean mean
oscar,someone please explain it to kevin
meredith,why cant you my time is just as valuable as yours
phyllis,not according to the beans
angela,this is how you make this important decision
andy,theres no way that stanley gets more beans than me starts to take stanleys beans stanley swats andys hand with his crossword puzzle that is ridiculous this is how it works everyone continues to argue
phyllis,its not so much that i might not get a raise its just demeaning
andy,thank you that is exactly by the way i would also like a raise
phyllis,yeah i would too
dwight,are we idiots gets up starts walking around what right does jim have to claim authority hmm is he as good a salesman as i is he as matronly as phyllis there are moments where we can affect change for a few seconds every decade we exist and these are those seconds let us storm his castle come on tick lets get him tock lets get jim tick and drag jim out of his office tock take his keys away from him tick thats a clock the time is getting very close its now or never what say you
phyllis,i say no
dwight,no i mean what do you say to my plan all groan okay
michael,leaving his office hurrying to jims office
kevin,what does a bean mean
michael,in jims office how you doing
jim,uh on a scale of one to ten id say im about a four
michael,oh what are you usually
jim,six you
michael,usually a ten but im feeling like a zero
jim,i mean a performancebased raise sounded like a good idea right
michael,i know i know
jim,we tried to find the fairest way to do it
michael,yes we did
jim,i just what
michael,um nothing i just i used to have to do this part alone and it was the worst i have something i would like to give you leaves office
phyllis,michael
kevin,michael
phyllis,come on this isnt fair
jim,to camera michaels my only friend left in the office except pam i think is she still upset
phyllis,at michael return to jims office michael you cannot just keep avoiding us like this
jim,michael give jim a worlds best boss mug thank you

jim,whats in here
michael,gin toast sip
jim,ooh
michael,someone knocks just pretend were not here
ryan,heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding
pam,yeah i mean if its all the same for you
ryan,question for you would you guys rather have $100 now or $5000 a year from now
pam,$100 now for sure
ryan,because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee i put in a hundred of my own money as the gift
pam,yeah no no ill um the hundred ill just take the hundred
ryan,instead of $5000 a year from now
pam,how sure is this
pam,the guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game
pam,im sorry you guys have probably noticed my stomachs a little more sensitive lately so if you wouldnt mind wearing a little less perfume and if your lunch is especially pungent maybe have it in the break room
jim,we would really appreciate it
dwight,pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy if she eats something the fetus doesnt like she is screwed its amazing a three ounce fetus is calling the shots its so bad ass
pam,phyllis if you could switch to a different soap just for a month or two yours is kind of perfumy
phyllis,now this is getting ridiculous
dwight,oh gee im sorry i guess i missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant no i reserve the right to peel my hardboiled eggs at my desk
meredith,all morning i look forward to my afternoon cigars and im not stopping for anyone
pam,i dont think im asking for too much i guess its just the end of courtesy in the workplace
andy,dwight peels a hardboiled egg at his desk sniffs it and takes a bite pam stares at him picks up her trash can and pukes into it watching people get sick always makes me sick and frankly so does talking about it so wow  andy phyllis meredith erin oscar and angela all proceed to throw up in various places while creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles dwight stares shocked pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look
michael,standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding what do you think i spent all morning on it

dwight,very smart
michael,and you everybody can laugh it doesnt have to just be the idiots everybody can laugh
jim,no
michael,yeah go ahead
jim,alright hey everyone thanks for coming
pete,douche
jim,aw thanks pete that was really nice i just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight and i want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight especially the flordia cousins who obviously cant take a hint laughter four years ago i was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend and i had to do the hardest thing that ive ever had to do which was just to wait uh dont get me wrong i flirted with her pam i can now admit in front of my friends and family that i do know how to make a photo copy didnt need your help that many times and do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick
pam,like a year
jim,ive been driving stick since high school so yes for a really long time thats all i had i just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend and a lot of people told me i was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who i worked with but i think even then i knew that i was waiting for my wife so  i would like to propose a toast so if youd all raise your glasses not pam for obvious reasons but everyone else if you would raise your glasses
mema,whats obvious why cant pam drink
jim,pam cant drink i didnt i shouldnt have said that i dont know why i did she can do whatever she wants though she shouldnt she shouldnt because shes an alcoholic pam is an alcoholic thats not true i no what we want the real reason is that that pams pregnant
michael,clears throat ok ok hey what i think jim is trying to say is that they had an accident and you know what these two people theyre living together theyre having lots of consentual sex
mema,they were living together
michael,yes yes they were living together yes and you know what you cant expect them to be careful every time because frankly its just a different sensation
jim,michael
michael,when you c well am i wrong they say its not different but its a different sensation
jim,oh my god please
michael,when you use something to block i think everybody knows what i am talking about its not necessarily different for the woman
pam,michael
michael,but its different for the ok ok
pam,michael stop
michael,alright my point is i said what i wanted to say and mema i hope you heard every word
jim,alright
michael,jim
jim,to waiting
everyone,quiet and scattered to waiting
mema,i should have known the hotels television set had a movie on called bruno last night the remote control had so darn many buttons on it i couldnt turn it off so i had to just sit there while it happened to me i wondered how could they pick such a hotel hmmm now i know
pam,mema
michael,that was a little touch and go at first but i think we saved it
jim,i cant believe it was me
michael,i know i cant believe it was you either i actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me
jim,is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things
michael,i have not found that to be the case
pam,hey smooth guys
jim,im so sorry
michael,can you believe it he screwed up not me
pam,memas not coming to the wedding shes leaving tomorrow morning
jim,oh my god are you serious
michael,theres gonna be a free room
michael,hi mema its michael
mema,oh youre that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse
michael,yes yep one in the same may i
michael,i am actually great with old women in fact for the longest time my best friend was my grandma and then she met harriet and now she thinks shes better than everybody
mema,i want to go to bed but i cant i cant turn that television off
michael,oh ok well hook you up there turns off tv
mema,oh thank you
michael,youre welcome
mema,it was that horrible charlie rose
michael,oh isnt he terrible may i heres the thing umm mema i think you just need to chill out about this whole pam getting pregnant thing its not 1890 anymore its modern day and women have sex before marriage and i think we need to celebrate that and i know in your day she would be considered a whore but now women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them thats part of life
mema,people are like cats and dogs these days
michael,exactly
mema,this used to be such a great country
michael,i know
mema,i dont know what happened to it
michael,theyre gonna name the baby after you you know theyre gonna call it mema
mema,you mean sylvia
michael,yes and if its a boy they will call it sylvio
andy,partay room 639
kevin,yes
andy,chicks are gonna be off the hook guys too oscar like calvin klein models

andy,no one from the office has been to a real bernard throw down
andy,if i was girl i would seriously reconsdier coming to this party but dont tell anyone that i said that cause i want them to come
angela,and where do you think youre going

jim,once a year dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate because as we all know the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change
dwight,how can i pose this to you in a relatable way  you are all members of the yakuza and you happen to be visiting the lackawanna trolley museum and you are attacked by triads how can you hold them off until your clan arrives  you cannot go wrong with a throat punch screams pretends to punch meredith in the throat
jim,ok so theres no defense for that good to know

jim,ok with all due respect to everyone here i think the most worthy opponent of you is you
dwight,that is correct  unless there happened to be measles present
jim,so lets just say that dwight has come at you with the throat punch  now how would you dwight defend against it
dwight,easy  allow me to demonstrate  i am attacking myself with a throat punch  here it comes gives himself a fake throat punch  block  grasp wrist as such grasps wrist
jim,and what if he comes at you with the other hand because he does have two
dwight,good point  second throat punch absorb the blow gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself  groin punch hip block elbow to the gut  uh oh up to the nose  no youre not  ow  oh

michael,ok use your imaginations
andy,whod you get
erin,naughty nellie nutmeg a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal
andy,oooooo saucy
erin,how about you

oscar,its my blackberry michael i am trying to get updates on the company
michael,whos michael  im caleb crawdad i do declare
ryan,you dont have to keep saying i do declare  any time you say something it means you are declaring
michael,that is the way southern people talk
jim,and what designing woman are you basing that on
michael,delta burke i do declare  now shall we get to the mystery
pam,ill go  stands up begins speaking with a southern accent   my name is deborah u tante   deb for short
andy,thats clever debutante
pam,bill bourbon was my uncle  i would have never hurt him any more than id hurt a june bug
meredith,nice accent  you sound like forrest gump
pam,i do not
andy,well you do actually  youve got this kinda like florida panhandle thing going whereas what you really want is more of a savannah accent which is more like molasses just sorta spillin out of your mouth
kevin,oooo now do the swedish chef
andy,uh not familiar what province is he from
kevin,he lives on sesame street dumbass
phyllis,you know i think im supposed to say something to pam i mean deb ok  in character i overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept
dwight,wait a minute wait a minute  im the butler  you were listening in on that  you rich people  you think you can do whatever you want to the servant class
michael,no no no dont turn this into a political thing
dwight,i will poison your food
andy,i reckon i got something to say to miss beatrix bourbon ifn she dont mind
michael,oooooo doggie we got a party now
michael,i do believe that the game is a big hit people are really diving into their characters
kevin,yall
creed,creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office  sorry im late boss  whats going on
michael,accent sir there has been a murder and you are a suspect
creed,ok hang on just a second  let me just settle in and ill be right back
michael,very good very good  now no one was there in the wine cellar creed gets in his car and drives away
andy,in character hey there young lady
erin,hello
andy,i would be remiss if i did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend
erin,sounds like a plan sugar
andy,alright a plan it is
dwight,voodoo mama juju explain your dalliance with the dark arts
angela,its not my fault i was exposed to harry potter
dwight,i know you did it
dwight,i know she didnt do it  its never the person you most suspect its also never the person you least suspect since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most  therefore i know the killer to be phyllis aka beatrix bourbon the person i most medium suspect
kevin,in character do you want to go out on a date with me  we can make out by the horses
erin,well you know ol nellies always up for a romp in the hay
meredith,how about a threesome
erin,yeah my boudoirs always open
kevin,nice
andy,im a little worried i might have asked out naughty nellie and not erin  which would be a whole lot less appealing because naughty nellie says yes to everyone  and she might be a murderer
oscar,i just got an email from corporate specifically for accounting to stop all payments to our vendors
phyllis,what does that mean
oscar,well maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity
michael,accent whoa whats this strange yankee accent coming out of your mouth son  this heres savannah
oscar,tries to speak in a highpitched southern accent this plantation were running low on greenbacks  were having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt  we cant pay in regular voice  michael i cant  basically it could mean a lot of things but it is unprecedented so its cause for concern
jim,ok im going back to work
michael,no no no no no no no accent im going to skip forward to a relevant clue  here we go
voice on cd player,well by now youve figured out that ol beatrix bourbon was the killer
phyllis,michael i was doing so well
michael,accent are you going to believe that that is a mis thats a misdirection  we still dont know who the murderer is  everyone leaves nellie nutmeg come back in here  i cant do this myself  voodoo mama juju what am i gonna do
jim,ok so corporate is still in their meeting
kevin,that could be a good sign
angela,hey everyone kevins going to give us his take on the situation  lets listen up

kevin,now jim telling us all to work  i think that is a very good sign
angela,dont just say things

stanley,do we have to play
jim,no
stanley,super
dwight,oh this could be a juicy one
michael,get in there
jim,i think today was a good day to have two managers  cause if youre a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean one parent might want to just keep rowing  but if the other parent wants to play a game its not because theyre crazy  its because theyre doing it for the kids  and i get that now
michael,there has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue  my little heart can barely take it no more  regular voice today is the hardest i have worked in a long long time
andy,andy michael and dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other i didnt do it

oscar,dwight enters dressed as recyclops not again
dwight,bow down before recyclops
jim,five years ago corporate said we had to start a recycling program for earth day so dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named recyclops
dwight,happy earth day everyone im recyclops did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter
jim,the next year he really stepped things up
dwight,who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin
jim,a year after that recylcops really began to take shape
dwight,recylops will drown you in your overwatered lawns
jim,then tragedy struck recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing i cant remember
dwight,recyclops will have his revenge
jim,i think this was also the year he renounced earth day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved
pam,oh my god you guys look its recyclops
dwight,recyclops destroys starts tearing through the office
stanley,oh is today recyclops day
dwight,yes
stanley,i thought you were killed by polluticorn
dwight,polluticorn wishes starts spraying the office with something
andy,thats aerosol spray its terrible for the environment
dwight,humans are terrible for the environment
pam,the thing i like most about recyclops is that hes creating a different world for our child
jim,mmm
pam,a world where you truly can be anything you want
jim,god bless you recyclops and your cold robot heart dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses

michael,i just i fell in love with those kids  and i didnt want to see them fall victim to the system so i made them a promise  i told them that if they graduated from high school i would pay for their college education  ive made some empty promises in my life but hands down that was the most generous

jim,let me guess you think you should get it
dwight,this encompasses all available data  hours tardiness unconfirmed sick days participation  everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency  also this should be accompanied by a monetary prize
jim,well in an ideal world
dwight,in an ideal world i would have all ten fingers on my left hand so my right hand could just be a fist for punching
jim,okay if its all the same to you im just going to take away survival skills and selfdefense

student 2,hey mr scott  what you gonna do  what you gonna do make our dreams come true
michael,wow
dwight,hey so jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in
kevin,hey
dwight,so jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole employee of the month thing
kevin,jim said that
dwight,he thought you were doing an incredible job last month
kevin,jim said that
dwight,you seem suprised
kevin,no no that makes total sense
dwight,hey buddy so every
oscar,sure puts in the twenty
dwight,five minutes ahead of schedule  right on schedule
teacher,politicians are always coming around telling us theyre going to fix our schools promising this and that  but you mr scott you are actually doing it  you have taught these kids with hard work that anything is possible  you are a dream maker and i thank you  i thank you i thank you i thank you i thank you  so much
lefevre,there were a lot of times over the years where i was pressured to get into the drug game  but i always thought back to my guardian angel and the gift that you gave me  so i just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go to college educate myself and become the next president obama
michael,crying oh god  oh god
jim,okay ladies and gentlemen welcome  i know youre all very excited but no matter who gets this i just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes  and the winner is employee number nine  and that is
andy,number nine number nine  jim halpert
everyone,huh  what
oscar,are you kidding me
dwight,oh no
jim,okay wait i was not i did not
kevin,i i i did not that was not how come not
jim,guys listen  this was anonymous all right  there is no way i couldve given it to myself because i didnt even know who was on here  i just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score
angela,to my tally you just won back your own parking spot a vacation day and a nice tidy quarter of $1000 from all of us
jim,will everybody stop for a second because obviously im not taking any of it  a mistake has been made and well figure it out  second of all there was no cash prize
angela,yes
jim,dwight
dwight,yeah you said in an ideal world there would be a cash prize  isnt that what you said
jim,no dwight i meant yes in a perfect world someone would get money  but
phyllis,yeah but in your perfect world only you get money
teacher,lets put your hands together and give a warm welcome for the man of the hour mr michael scott
michael,all right  wow  um i am never going to forget today  not a chance  i dont think i could ever give back to you what you have given me today  who here has done something stupid in their lives  like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between a gym and b gym that sort of thing  show of hands anybody yes a bunch of you okay  well me too ive done something stupid which i would like to share  ummm period bell rings should we go
teacher,oh no  were okay  its a double period
michael,ah  all right  i came here today because i promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable  but you know whats invaluable is intuition  you know what that is  that is the ability to know when something is about to happen  does anybody out there have intuition  know whats gonna happen next  nobody  okay youre going to make me say it  all right i am so proud of all of you  derrick and lefevre and ben and ayana and mikela and nikki and jason and im sorry okay sorry spacing your name
zion,im zion im mikelas younger brother
michael,well zion i am not going to be paying for your college tuition  which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybodys tuition  im so so sorry
michael,im sorry  im sorry  im so sorry
michael,you lied to us
michael,i lied to myself too  im not a millionaire  i thought i would be by the time i was 30 but i wasnt even close  and then i thought maybe by the time i was 40 but by 40 i had less money than when i was 30  maybe by my 50s i dont know  i wanted to pay for your education  i really did  it was my dream  some people have evil drems some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams  my dream was in the right place
lefevre,you owe this to us
michael,okay hold on  hold on  now i cant pay for your college  but you dont have to go to class to be in class  online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience  and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop students perk up which is rendered useless without batteries and i have one for each of you
student 2,yelling
michael,hey holdhold on hold on hold on hold on  theyre lithium
jim,look there was a big mistake obviously so i will fix it  okay  this was your idea anyway
andy,correction  it was my idea
jim,okay
dwight,my idea
creed,guys im starting to think pams not really even pregnant
pam,ok for the record i am pregnant and obviously there has been some kind of a mistake so why doesnt jim just pick the next highest score on the list and well move on
phyllis,thats fair
dwight,excellent idea pam
pam,thank you
andy,that would be employee number three which would be son of a bitch pam halpert
phyllis,how is that possible  no offense pam but how the hell is that possible
dwight,there must be some reasonable explanation for this
pam,no wait come on  i didnt miss a day i came in early i stayed late and i doubled my sales last month
andy,oh really from what two to four
pam,yup
jim,guys this isnt some elaborate scam okay
delivery man,hi i have an order here for a custom cake jim halpert

pam,okay okay yeah
christian,so youve just been bought by sabre youve probably got a lot of questions hi im christian slater whats it like to work for sabre lets find out together working at sabre means taking on the challenge of the road that rises to meet you sabre is respecting the past but opening a window to the future have you ever tasted a rainbow at sabre you will
jo bennett,youll find it easy to embrace the sabre spirit welcome were very excited to go on this journey with you
jim,christian slater impression so youve been shown a nonsensical video youre probably wondering whats going on well youre not alone
michael,wow really terrific
gabe,most of our business comes from selling printers so dont think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore but as printer salesmen who also sell paper
michael,perfect
michael,no dont like that
gabe,at sabre we really encourage honest communication you should always feel free to express your thoughts your
meredith,talk about vacation days
gabe,we have a policy here at sabre where we are uh allowed to take two weeks

angela,i already booked a great lakes cruise
meredith,hey who the hells going through our stuff

michael,mm nope dont like that
gabe,ok did everyone get one with these bottles we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles which are the scourge of the environment
michael,well still get to use the little cups though right
gabe,little cups like paper or plastic or
michael,i dont know what theyre made of
dwight,theyre 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic he goes through 20 a day
gabe,ok well i bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle
michael,you know what cant fit in a bottle are the 20 little trips i take to the cooler and the 20 little scans i do of everybody to make sure everythings running smoothly and the 20 little conversations that i have with stanley
stanley,thats ok
michael,there is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company but 70 percent of me is water and the other part the real part the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and if i can be crass makes babies that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba
michael,in line to fill up water bottle behind kevin and toby really you dont have enough water in there your stomach
toby,oop
michael,what
toby,looks like we kicked it indicates water jug is empty
michael,i miss the old dunder mifflin too much change is not a good thing ask the climate
michael,i dont want to appear ungrateful for everything sabres doing for us
gabe,oh i dont get that sense at all from you so
michael,well you should have a little but its great that you dont because i am trying to embrace all of these changes but im  ill be honest im having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of em
gabe,which ones
michael,all of them
gabe,well i wish that i could do something but its kind of policy you know above my pay grade you know
michael,so maybe we should call we should call someone i could help im good with bosses call one of the higherups
gabe,you know what let me see what i can do

erin,i think when andy finally asks me out hes going to try to top what he did with the drum line i cant wait to see what he comes up with
andy,the balls totally in erins court after the whole drum line thing
gabe,on videochat  first let me say that i told them everything you wanted me to say in just the way you wanted me to say it so
jo,gabe honey i love this i love the sound of your voice but i really need some new information now
gabe,ok um i told the story of your uncle and i have a feeling that you would have michael gesturing behind computer really been proud of the way okay um
jo,wait a minute who is it whos there is there somebody in the room with you michael gesturing no i want to see who it is turn me around
gabe,i dont  its just
jo,turn me around now michael starts to leave jo whistles hey buddy is it something i said

jo,aw thank you ive been working on it since i was a little girl to um to what do i owe the pleasure of this videochat
michael,well i am little concerned with all of these changes to be quite frank i think we have done things a certain way here at dunder mifflin for quite some time and
jo,pardon pardon me mr scott but the last time i saw a company as mismanaged as dunder mifflin it was my grandsons snowball company so youll excuse me if i prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things
michael,ok i feel very strongly that you cant just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever is christian slater back there because he knows hed know what to do
jo,so listen why dont you tell gabe if by the end of the day you cant handle the changes
michael,i have already told him but i will tell him again if you think that will help
jo,i would take until the end of the day if i were you michael leaves conference room

jerry,seriously you told her
jim,did it it might have come up while we were waiting for you
jerry,and you  you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going

dwight,jo leaves i uh
kelly,reading her valentines card from andy oh my god
kelly,i guess andy likes me i never thought of him in that way but i guess in most romantic comedies the guy youre supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way you might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual
pam,so check this out according to the handbook you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager they have all these incentive programs i ran your numbers from last year
jim,this is way more than i make now

jo,really
jim,really
michael,yeah you can take the man out of the salesman but you cant take the sales out of salesman
jo,well i think youre both being a little too modest

pam,kevin youre such a gourmand
kevin,i cooked my way through julia childs cookbook and now im halfway through the twilight cookbook  last night i had edwards corn flake chicken
pam,hmm
kevin,pregnant pam and i we get hungry at the same times so weve been eating together a lot  not all meals  just second breakfast lunch second lunch and first dinner
kevin,i thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner  one last ultra feast
pam,mmmm that sounds great  what are you thinking
kevin,i think it should be a surprise
meredith,after pam has a contraction  oh getting there huh
pam,no no  i still have time
pam,im having contractions but theyre irregular and far apart  so im not really in labor im near labor
jim,yeah were slowplaying it because of our stupid hmo
pam,if we check in after midnight i get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors
jim,not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home if its crying all night one of us is going to have to take care of it  and i do not plan on helping unless its a boy
pam,i cannot wait for that joke to be over
pam,ooh
michael,oh oh oh  contraption  shes contrapting  okay you know what  i think i should drive you guys to the hospital and here is why  i am a licensed classy driver in the state of pennsylvania  i gassed up the car
jim,michael
michael,actually i put diesel in this time trying to save some money
jim,michael you shouldnt have done that
michael,happy to do it  also i did a heck of a job babyproofing this office
pam,you know the babys not going to live here right
michael,well the baby was conceived here so might as well live here a little bit too
jim,hmm that logics airtight but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here  burning man portopotty
michael,oh yuck  tmi  how was it  i dont want to know  tell me later  lets go  lets go  hospital
pam,okay okay were not going to the hospital  we are waiting until midnight
erin,ooh spooky  but why
jim,because the insurance company only covers two nights
pam,everythings fine  we have plenty of time
nick,well you dont want to wait too long pam  otherwise the babys going to become a teenager in there and youll be up all night from the rock music
michael,shut up nick  what a weird thing to say  weird it nerd  dont get revenge on me nerd
angela,as nick looks over at her  what are you looking at
dwight,ha nerd
kelly,did you know that labor can last weeks  then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table and sometimes epidurals dont work and you can poop yourself
dwight,with angela in the break room  bare my child
angela,excuse me
dwight,i want to have a child for business reasons and i want you to be the mother  if you agree say nothing  if you disagree say anything  very well  lets meet at 400 pm at our old meeting spot and bang it out
jim,after pam has another contraction  thats seven minutes  here we go  this is happening  come on
pam,hold on hold on  it isnt midnight yet
jim,are you serious  pam
pam,no the doctor said every five to seven minutes
jim,i  pam please
pam,im going to be okay we should really try to make it until midnight
andy,yeah no you really should  because if your babys born tomorrow hes going to have the same birthday as buttmud brooks  my old roommate
pam,did you hear that  buttmud brooks
jim,okay but we are leaving at five minutes apart
pam,five minutes apart
jim,so the plan was seven minutes  but were calling an audible because thats her call  because shes the quarterback  im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant
pam,okay stop watching me
jim,okay crazy  i think i have some better things to do with my day than worry about you like sell printers
pam,mmhmm
jim,well not until friday 20 off toner cartridges thats a big deal  while were on the subject why dont i just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check
pam,not until midnight
andy,guys  word of advice  speaking as a former baby  dont get too hung up on baby names  i was named walter jr after my father until i was about six or so when my parents changed their minds
erin,i thought you said your younger brother was named walter jr
andy,my brother was born and my parents felt he better exemplified the walter jr name so they gave it to him  i was given andrew which they got out of a baby name book
jim,you know its getting real crowded in here  maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet
michael,no no no no no  you know what  you cant tell us what to do because you are not comanager anymore
jim,as andy and kevin shout yeah in response to michael okay i feel like this noise is going to prevent pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals
pam,actually the distractions are good  i mean i dont think im going to make it until midnight if im just sitting here thinking about it
michael,distractions are good  that means conference room five minutes  no no five seconds  right now right now  conference room  topic potpourri  lets go
michael,um i am sort of a master of distraction  when i was a kid my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class  try to think what were the first thirteen colonies  mmhmm mmhmm  michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises
michael,the purpose for this meeting is to take pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body
andy,can we do sleight of hand tricks
michael,i will allow that
andy,yes  can anyone do those
stanley,im going to go look at the internet
jim,as pam has another contraction  oh  oh alright  thats a good one

michael,as pam gives the thumbs up  that sounds good  do you need some music or  okay
andy,nope actually music would just throw me off  i need complete silence  okay  pam begins to clap as andy dances  youre clapping  i need complete silence  totally threw me off so im going to have to start over  evolution of dancedance
ryan,reading from a book as kelly admires  you let me in your bed  but now i sleep alone  trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home
erin,naming race horses  affirmed  seattle slew  secretariat  citation  assault  count fleet  whirlaway  war admiral  omaha  gallant fox  and  i know this  uh  the jockey was johnny loftus  sired by star shoot

michael,i would like your undivided attention please
dwight,you couldnt handle my undivided attention
michael,over the last few weeks things have been changing here sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads i think its kind of screwed up because the way this place used to work was make friends first make sales second make love third in no particular order
dwight,listen michael  about what happened earlier
michael,yeah
dwight,when i was asking about the leads
michael,mhmm
dwight,is there any news on the leads

stanley,we need those leads michael its our job michael michael
gabe,on phone michael we spent a lot of money on those leads you have to give them out
michael,then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour okay just  imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone you got an icecream cone if that were the case then in the summertime everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an icecream cone
gabe,michael i dont want to incentivise murder but  weve tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff
michael,they act like i have no power
gabe,but you do you are in charge
michael,thank you
gabe,of supporting the sales staff you are required to hand out those leads michael
michael,hmm well if that is what i am required to do i will do exactly that
gabe,okay good
michael,exactly that
gabe,good

angela,oh how the tables have turned i see you got my email

kelly,dont use your cute baby to make us like you
jim,shes wearing a onesie holds out his cell phone oscar leans in but kelly grabs his arm
stanley,if we act nice now then were rewarding them for treating us poorly
jim,didnt we kind of start it
phyllis,i think youre remembering that wrong
andy,yeah
phyllis,i dont know about this i mean i think we should hold our ground the companys changed and if they dont like it they can leave i mean a lot of their work can be done from india
jim,can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable and may be heading for something bad
andy,all those who agree say aye all present  stanley andy and phyllis   raise their hands all those opposed
jim,i dont think we need opposed
michael,kicking through rubbish at the dump youve changed man
dwight,oh why because i have a shot at a $100k commission
michael,since when do you care about money when i first met you you were a wideeyed innocent
dwight,hey there is nothing i can do about my wideset eyes
michael,no im talking about your personality dwight
dwight,when i first met you i had a lot of job offers and i had an offer from ivan schartsky the ivan schartsky and if id assistant managed him
michael,assistant to the managed him
dwight,oh thats low i would be number two right now at home depot
michael,yeah
dwight,okay because they promote from within instead i had to follow you  you going nowhere
michael,you think you would have done better without me really
dwight,i hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs
michael,wow ohhhkay man when i think about all the time i wasted being your friend  i shouldnt have been hanging out watching karate movies with you
dwight,kungfu movies
michael,you know what i should have been doing i should have been out at bars finding my soulmate finding my wife making babies
dwight,nice babies youre making with the floozies at the bars
michael,thats my wife youre talking about man
dwight,your madeup wife who doesnt exist michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at dwight who sidesteps you watch it
michael,if i wanted to hit you i would have hit you
dwight,dont do it lobs something at michael
michael,no no you just made an enemy with the wrong guy dwight they throw volleys of rubbish at each other no time out time out michael inspects a box then hurls it at dwight time in
dwight,no lunges for a large wooden spool
michael,dont even think about that dwight begins rolling it towards michael as he reaches him dwight kicks it and falls backward the spool comes to a halt in front of michael and michael pushes it towards dwight
dwight,kicks spool stop it get out thats my spool
phyllis,whats the least we can do to make this okay
jim,ill text pam shes really good at this stuff
andy,and ill text erin shes really good at this stuff too
phyllis,i guess we could give them some of our new commissions
stanley,that is a dangerous precedent
jim,pam texted back saying we could give them all ipods
phyllis,oh if they dont have an ipod by now they really dont want one
jim,alright then were back to cash and i got to say if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over im for it
phyllis,okay fine cash it is
andy,erin just texted me back people love shells from faraway beaches
michael,okay dwight here we go picks up a sink spills dump juice on his pants oh god
dwight,oh halfheartedly throws something
michael,were never going to find those leads are we they both sit on the edge of a clawfooted bathtub
dwight,surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them wow amazing isnt it no other animal on earth could do this maybe beavers but not like this
phyllis,so how about guys one percent commission a month instead of two what do you
jim,no we agreed two percent for the quarter okay others enter hey everybody

michael,andy shes not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with all right and besides who doesnt tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them thats like thats like mr and mrs smith crap
andy,i was going to tell her just on my own time
michael,you know what i resent the implication that i would keep that secret everyone here knows that i cant and wont keep a secret
andy,who cares i mean its not like i killed someone big deal right this can blow over in two seconds she never asked me so if you think about it i probably should have told her i guess everybody does stupid things
angela,psst hey erin
erin,you want to talk to me come to my desk
angela,you embarrassed me earlier
erin,oh take it up with the chief of police
angela,you think i want people remembering i had sensual relations with andy its the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled i want to throw up just thinking about it

angela,you are throwing up for the wrong reasons
toby,standing behind erin i dont think this fax is going through is there a different i can just put it through again you know
pam,hey you know i was engaged before jim
erin,really
pam,yeah and he worked here too
erin,it was andy wasnt it

erin,i hope you find what youre looking for
pam,thank you kisses jim on the cheek
gabe,talking on the phone so i can reprimand them but i cant suspend them oh i cant do either uh huh fair enough
pam,answers phone hey toby

pam,very interesting
toby,yeah i also learned some interesting things about how they structure
pam,gabe walks in thanks toby
gabe,hey everyone hi quite an afternoon huh cathartic in a way im glad i got to share it with you it makes you think about whats really important pam hands jim a note its not about showing youre in charge or flexing some sort of authority its about forgiveness and yes im talking about you three in this desk clump right here i think that if you were to apologize to me then i would revoke your suspension
pam,i dont think an apology is enough i really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension
jim,and i got to take this bad attitude and i got to go home and i got to adjust it and i hope the suspension does that
dwight,gets up and walks towards gabe prideful idiots watch how its done jim and pam get their things together and start to leave gabriel i apologize
gabe,great
dwight,gets on one knee i kneel before you
gabe,guys i would even take a contrite look as an apology
dwight,humbly taking your hand upon which i kiss to show my contrition
gabe,following jim and pam to their car guys to err is human trying to block their car
erin,trust is the most important thing to me is your name andy bernard whats your real name lionel frankenstein

jim,yeah or maybe we dont even need that
michael,can you smell the power of the halperts power couple
dwight,you know what i should be getting this client michael my numbers are better than either of theirs
michael,i went with the people i thought would put the best face on the company
dwight,if you want people to put the best face on something why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives
jim,whispers thats a good point
pam,this is our first joint sales pitch i think were gonna work really well together
jim,yeah i think we have complimentary strengths we understand each other
pam,we have good give and take vaudeville delivery i give he takes

jim,all right
donna,you have some ancestors in common somewhere back
angela,i knew it you should see their baby

jim,none of this is time sensitive
michael,uh yes uh the sale is on now through may
donna,oh yeah thank you
michael,okay i have more of them
gabe,you would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate a twoweek training program at the yale school of management obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities
darryl,sounds all right
dwight,what is this
gabe,oh this is print in all colors sabres minority executive training program
dwight,it doesnt just sound aight it sounds amazing
darryl,i didnt say aight
dwight,how do i apply
gabe,you have to be a minority
dwight,uh glasses wearers cholera survivors geniuses nonorganic family farmers the list goes on and on you want me to keep going
gabe,those dont really count were thinking more ethnic and racial minorities
dwight,come here come here
gabe,hmm
dwight,ten seconds ago this guy was driving a forklift okay now all off a sudden hes cinderella of the office what are you guys thinking
gabe,well
darryl,i like the sound of this looks at dwight maybe one day ill be sitting in michaels chair wouldnt that be something
dwight,one minority from this branch is going to get into this program who would i refer hmm the competent hardworking one who does things his own way or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines
kelly,on phone this is the second time that youve sent me the wrong size i mean i know what a four feels like ive been a four my whole life you know what you can go to hell all right thanks for nothing
dwight,oh man white people right
kelly,i dont know if she was white
dwight,well you can kinda tell from the voice
kelly,yeah
dwight,i bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot just because of your race
kelly,well they say its because of texting but maybe youre right
dwight,i think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program
kelly,never thought of myself as an executive before
dwight,i know cause you have no role models how many indian ceos can you think of
kelly,i cant think of any ceos any race
dwight,you could be the indian bill gates you could be the indian ted turner
kelly,i could be the indian julia roberts
dwight,thats not shes okay yes
michael,i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier and i want to show you there we go michaels picture pops up on the powerpoint screen whoa look at those vivid colors look at my eyes those are shrekgreen eyes that is me again i think this displays the crisp dazzling white
donna,mmhmm
michael,and that would be a display image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up of the crisp gorgeous black
donna,yeah
michael,its subtle thats how it works i show her an image that turns her on 	and then she looks at me then back at me then back at the image soon she doesnt know what is me what is the image she just knows that shes turned on
michael,this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts ive never taken anybody there before
donna,who took the photo
michael,ryan
donna,oh michael quickly advances powerpoint show to last slide which is sex in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly
michael,and thats it thats me thats who i am
donna,giggles not bad
michael,oh thanks softly youre not bad either
donna,thank you michael tries t kiss donna donna clears throat hmm
michael,hmm
donna,oh my god realizing jim and pam are looking through the conference room windows
michael,jim could you come in here for a sec what was that printer we were looking at
michael,in his office you didnt see it pam she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move shortbread
jim,no
pam,ill have one
jim,well maybe you shouldnt try to kiss people at work
michael,oh really jim what about pam and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss maybe this could be my pam
jim,okay well all that is irrelevant
pam,maybe michael has a point i mean if she was really that upset she wouldnt still be here
donna,was it professional no but i work in the nightlife industry i get hit on all the time in my 20s it would have been annoying in my late 20s i find it really flattering
michael,look i know that i screwed up in there i know that i probably messed up your sale i just want to go in and fix it
pam,what if i back out and you finish the pitch with jim
jim,what
jim,what was that
pam,just let him flirt with her people meet each other all sorts of ways
jim,pam you know hes not gonna get anywhere and hes gonna blow our sale
pam,who cares michael peeking at them through his office window its not that huge a sale
jim,hey the schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale
pam,dont act like you understood anything that guy said pats jims arm good luck wingman salutes
dwight,how as being a minority affected you
kelly,well theres a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an indian guy
dwight,oh good and you resent this because
kelly,indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants its so dorky
dwight,oh no no thats not dorky dwight wears his phone like that look its easily accessible boom like this 911 hello scranton stranglers in the house inside the house
kelly,just put it in your pocket
michael and dwight,indistinct chatter inside conference room
kevin,looking it look at that shes totally flirting with him
phyllis,you dont know that some people cant help oozing sexuality
creed,you ever notice you can ooze two things sexuality and pus man i tell ya
phyllis,she just crossed her arms together thats bad
pam,maybe shes just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger
kevin,tries it by crossing his arms like that to andy
donna,is this is this the best you can do right there
jim,uh for that printer yes unfortunately we dont have a lot of flexibility
donna,oh well i guess im just used to the restaurant business removes sweater revealing her revealing top where if youre in charge then you can always get discounts for the people that you like
jim,yeah chuckles
michael,so maybe we could find a little wiggle room right
jim,whats that
michael,maybe wee find some wiggle room
jim,i dont i dont think so
michael,i think we could donna giggles
oscar,i dont see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money delivery alone will cost
michael,okay well sometimes sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money right like for tax purposes
oscar,actually ran the numbers on this and in this case it makes more financial sense to gain money
michael,why dont you run them again
jim,what if shes just flirting with you to get a better price
michael,if she is its working
kevin,yeah michael heres a trick ask her if she wants a mint if she says no then she is not interested
jim,she does not like him
pam,you can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them how do you think we got together
jim,cause i stopped by your desk like 15 times a day
pam,i was after your money
jim,well the joke was on you
pam,yes it was
kelly,typing can you stop micromanaging i know how to do this
ryan,okay
dwight,hey what are you guys doing
kelly,this girl was really rude to me at the mall so i created a fake im account from a hot guy at her high school and now im trying to make her anorexic
ryan,tell her everyone in home room thinks shes fat
kelly,oh that is so good
dwight,you know we really should keep practicing for this interview
kelly,oh thats okay ryan coached me
dwight,ryan what does he know
ryan,its easy you just turn every question around on them do you think youre treated differently because of your race
kelly,would you ask that same question if i was white were so in
dwight,we
kelly,when i become executive im gonna make ryan manager
ryan,and then the two of us are cleanin house
dwight,kelly will be even worse than darryl if youd have told me this morning that today id be creating a monster capable f my own destruction i d have thought you were referring to the bull mose and i are trying to reanimate
michael,so corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller
donna,mmhmm
michael,operating blahdy blahdy blah boilerplate pound of fish donna laughing just kidding do you like mints
donna,yes
michael,i carry mints with me sometimes you ever tried those
donna,oh i havent tried those no
michael,theyre good donna grabs mint

darryl,whats wrong with a level playing field
michael,do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson what if no one named hanson showed up that wouldnt even make sense or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50yearold guy who was a murderer really safe
jim,oh man so many points being made

oscar,this is hypothetical were talking about luke who happens to be terrible
michael,well then why arent you bugging me to fire everybody whos bad you just want me to fire luke thats reverse nepotism  he should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does

pam,so what happened
dwight,i went to the store and i pressed the buzzer and they looked right at me and then they looked away and then i pressed the buzzer again and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones i guess im not the kind of guy thats good enough for precious heirlooms

michael,well there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department but between the sheets we were like jordan and pippin
jan,well if theres anything exciting about it its because we both knew it was wrong
michael,because we work together
jan,no ok imagine theres a princess who falls for a guy beneath her station and the queen doesnt like this at all and the princess knows that the queen doesnt like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen

gabe,this wasnt really about meredith was it you and erin are broken up
andy,how is that relevant to anything
gabe,i asked you if it was ok if i asked her out you said and i quote my good sir nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand i specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way
andy,the only reason i said that is because you asked me so politely it was very difficult for me to say no
gabe,ill let this slide but i expect you to put this whole erin thing behind you
michael,oh wow another living room
carol,its a family room
michael,you put the tv here you put the family over here

andy,when i was a freshman in college i worked at the student newspaper the cornell daily sun this was at cornell i had to write an oped column every day  bernards regards
darryl,this was your freshman year
andy,i started to ask myself do i have big plans here i didnt want to become editor of that paper so i got up and walked right out of walter bernard hall and thats actually when i heard eight male voices singing unencumbered by instruments i was hooked so is becoming ceo of this company your a capella group  come on were going to dannys bar public school
darryl,no i got some work to do i do got big plans with this company
jim,to be honest i still cant believe he didnt call her back who doesnt call a dork like that back

michael,thats true thats true i dated her momma and you know what
jim,stop
michael,under his breath um kay uh alright
pam,one of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough
erin,didid you say vampire
pam,oh no its just that if a vampire had to cough he would do it like this coughs into elbow
dwight,uhhuh right and ruin their cloaks do you have any idea how expensive wool is in transylvania looks at camera cause of the euro
pam,well other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly dont come in if youre sick
dwight,rolls his eyes and shakes his head uh
pam,and get your flu shot also im going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office
dwight,no no no they will cost you your life
jim,elaborate
dwight,the worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it they need to fight their own battles if sabre really cared about our wellbeing they would set up hand desanitizing stations a simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt vomit fecal matter
pam,im not  im not going to do that im not going to do that
dwight,exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger
jim,so by that rationale if i had to sneeze i should just sneeze on you
dwight,yes i would welcome it
jim,sneezes on dwight looks at camera youre welcome
dwight,the principle is sound to avoid illness expose yourself to germs enabling your immune system to develop antibodies i dont know why everyone doesnt do this maybe they have something against living forever

pam,mmhmm
pam,i lied about some aspects of the building
jim,its still on a bike path though right
pam,theres no building it doesnt exist
jim,what does that mean
pam,i needed leverage so i pulled those pictures off the internet its just this office administrator thing i dont wanna
jim,what
pam,fail i dont want to fail again
jim,but you didnt fail
pam,and thats what you said about art school and thats what you said about sales
jim,and you didnt fail those things either
pam,well im not an artist and im not a salesman so what would you call it
jim,hey hey hey hey hey
oscar,michael the reason i asked you down here for this chat is that ive been thinking that your fears about china are a bit exaggerated
michael,did you know that china has a new missile that can sink a us naval carrier nine hundred miles off the coast
oscar,we have missiles too
michael,did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal but what do i know i mean thats just according to the pentagon our pentagon
nate,i wasnt here places a book in front of pam
pam,what
nate,i wasnt here its a pretty common saying you may want to log it away for future use
pam,well thanks
nate,yeah
michael,china has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars we are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives and they will control us
oscar,actually were in a mild recession right now ill give you that but people use china as the boogie man for all their problems in the nineteen eighties it was japan
michael,how then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in china has risen by 17 and in the us it has only risen by 8
oscar,do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economys heading in 2011 do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector id say thats far more relevant wouldnt you
michael,dont i
pam,hello hello youre breaking the law
dwight,impossible i love the law
pam,read article nineteen there are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting it also means no more cutting the tampons in two and no more tampering with the toilet paper
dwight,i see ive underestimated you and i didnt think that was possible nate reply the paper
nate,i dont think it goes that way
dwight,reply it
oscar,dont worry about the coffee its on me
michael,yeah i figured that
oscar,michael i am so happy that we were able to have this little chat
michael,wait you forgetting something
oscar,what
michael,this chat two men one white one latina a boss and a money cruncher i could fire you
erin,fire him no show mercy

andy,yeah clapping
erin,right yes
michael,i am talking about freedom about choice america i dont think you need to worry because if you want to beat china you will if you dont thats fine that my friend is your victory yknow a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to china and that may be the true but what they dont tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation you get to a friend so here is to conversation
oscar,thats not
michael,raise your cups on high case closed
oscar,that wasnt what we were discu that wasnt the whole
dwight,they say the best vampires dont bleed their victims dry but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again i spared pam and i may feast off of her profits for years to come i let pam win haha oh i was not motivated by compassion i have no compassion make sure you got that not motivated by compassion

holly,yeah i love him
michael,me too
andy,singing christmas tree christmas tree wont you be my christmas tree
pam,hey how about this one
andy,ehh seems a little full of itself right kind of a pretty boy what if we got a really beat up one like on charlie brown and we just loved it for what it is
pam,maybe i mean
darryl,on the phone i just no she be talking to your mom or something this is my daughter too justine you seem to think justine hangs up oh pick a damn tree already

andy,i dont have kids or anything but if my grandmother ever dies im going to kill myself
darryl,jada dont want to spend christmas with me she told her mom it wasnt as much fun and how could she say that you know i took her to the toy store to buy her own presents
pam,well darryl no kid wants to buy their own christmas presents
darryl,her mom wants me to take her to mass i guess thats something to do
pam,no you should have her mom do the boring christmas stuff on her time you should be associated with the fun parts of christmas
darryl,how do i do that
pam,bring her to the party yeah well have santa and well play games with her itll be a lot of fun
andy,yes
pam,youll be mr christmas by the end of the night

michael,hey there jada nice to see you again im santa claus welcome
darryl,are you serious
michael,its a sophisticated take
jada,he doesnt look like santa claus
darryl,no he doesnt to michael i told her santa would be here
michael,yeah well i was told that holly would be here single and ready to date and we all got misled
pam,who told you that
michael,nora ephron in every romantic comedy ever made
phyllis,so is it an open relationship
holly,oh god no
kelly,well youre almost 40 oh do you not want kids
holly,oh i want kids i really want kids but aj and i are practically engaged we talk about spending our lives together
kelly,so wheres the ring
pam,kelly um how are you adjusting to the move
phyllis,nobody cares about that look you have to make him commit or kick his butt to the curb
pam,you guys i dont think any of us are really qualified to be giving holly personal advice about her love life
erin,yeah i mean maybe hollys not in any position to be shooing guys away
erin,i dont get it im sorry i just i dont get it
holly,okay listen im gonna tell him that if he doesnt propose by the end of this year were over
pam,wow an ultimatum
holly,yeah
pam,it doesnt really seem like you
kelly,that is a great idea ultimatums are key basically nobody does anything for me anymore unless i threaten to kill myself
dwight,turns in pams chair with a pam wig on and laughs maniacally
jim,dont stop dwight dwight pelts jim with snowballs dwight stop dwight stop
dwight,oh no oh no
jim,stop
dwight,oh no yes taste my wrath
jim,okay okay okay
dwight,huh you like that
jim,seriously
dwight,huh
jim,okay okay dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally
dwight,yes i have a wig for every single person in the office you never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone
jim,i just want it to stop
pam,so cool right
ryan,theres no connection between the origin story and the quest
pam,okay
ryan,we need to know who jimmy halpert was before he was bitten by the bear otherwise its the bears quest
pam,okay well i just sorta meant like cute right
ryan,well did you come here for help or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is
pam,i mean help if its something simple like add page numbers or laminate it or
ryan,well it sounds like you know what you want pam walks away its also a little derivative of a serias called bear man did you look that up
pam,no
ryan,okay
toby,oh jim hey
jim,hey toby
toby,theres this female uh uh stenographer at the courthouse
jim,no way
toby,who looks exactly like you
jim,thats increadible
toby,yeah no its uncanny
jim,you know whats crazy
toby,what
jim,i cant reconnect with you right now hold on one second he hurls a snowball at dwight with a lacrosse stick misses and shatters a window everyone gasps excuse me clears throat
michael,i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer and some people you dont and thats just the way it is and i can be mature about that clip of michael throwing hollys woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it
angela,its so cold even with my coat on
meredith,maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing americans
gabe,yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy
holly,you guys this has to stop someone could have really gotten hurt
michael,what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window you know what would have happened the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off and yes it might have been funny but it also would have been incredibly tragic
dwight,i could not agree more and just want to state for the record that i am intending to sue jim for acute psychological distress
jim,what are you talking about youre the one terrorizing me
dwight,with snowballs jim with fluffy little snowballs no i thought we were just playing
holly,dwights right what you did was dangerous and inappropriate im really surprised at you guys last time i was here you were both best friends
michael,all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story you see this on my desk he holds up a toy taxi cab know who gave me this my girlfriend tara who lives in new york city
dwight,wait what girlfriend
michael,i havent told you about her
dwight,i find that unlikely you email me when you get a new zit
michael,im a man in my mid40s and i still get zits i think thats pretty interesting but you know what i am not on trial here the scranton strangler is so anyway we have this great weekend and she drives me to the airport and we get to jfk but i am flying out of laguardia so we laugh and laugh and laugh and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slomo drinking latte and at the end of the day she gives me this and she says michael maybe next time you should take a cab
holly,i didnt know you had a girlfriend
michael,i do she is
michael,did you see her face well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g scott and it aint tara
phyllis,so you went homemade this year
pam,yup
phyllis,yeah money problems is that what this is about i mean oh dear i dont think we can help you out
pam,no no jim had a great year actually i just wanted to get your opinion
phyllis,are you good at homemade
pam,look at this
phyllis,yeah
holly,walks in with a dirty woody who did this its obvious to me im not welcome here but somebody better tell me who did this or else im leaving
phyllis,well i dont think erin seems to like you
erin,thats not true i dont know her enough to make a decision even
michael,what happened what happened toby what did you do i think tobys very jealous of all the attention youve been getting
toby,no i would never ever do anything like that but it does seem like something you would do
michael,oh really turn it on me well isnt that nice thank you very much
kevin,wait wait guys listen toy story is all about toys that come to life when people arent looking you dont think its not possible that woody did this to himself
michael,it is christmas
angela,no it really seems like something michael would do
michael,mmhmm mmhmm well the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me and that i have been framed
andy,why would anyone frame you for that
jim,okay im sorry why are we discounting this whole woody came to life thing so quickly
michael,ahhhhhh laughs surprise it was part of the party pretty funny huh
holly,you think this is funny
michael,laughs i dont but someday i think we will laugh about this when we tell our kids
jim,yikes everyone gasps
kevin,oh no thats thats not happening
dwight,dear god in heaven
michael,all right shh okay you know what holly i didnt mean to do it it was an accident an accident borne of jealous feelings
holly,michael you have to let this go im with someone else i dont feel that way anymore
michael,oh really you certainly seemed jealous when i told you about my fake girlfriend thats what jim and dwight thought
dwight,okay hey hey hey
jim,no fake girlfriends are always wrong
holly,you made up a fake girlfriend to see if id get jealous and you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me what is the matter with you
michael,when you got transferred and i drove you up to nashua you said michael i love you but i cant do this but then with this other guy you dont have any problem with a longdistance relationship do you and you know what that is what is the matter with me
holly,michael im sorry
michael,and we did this whole stupid party for you
erin,blocks hollys path no
holly,you guys it wasnt my fault
kevin,oh nothing is ever your fault just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us
erin,i really think youre better off
michael,mmm erin would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me please
erin,yeah is she an amazing cook or something
jim,walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it reading the note hey pickles merry christmas open immediately love swiss cheese opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him everyone laughs damn it dwight
dwight,didnt think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing did you jim let that be a lesson to you all
stanley,so do they bring in food or do you get to go out
toby,no they bring it in
stanley,you lucky son of a bitch

erin,still id really like to see this office with you in the bosss chair
andy,dont even getting really happy and excited eeehhhh
erin,you in the bosss chair
andy,eeehhh no hehe
andy,in my family you dont really go out and get things if you want something you write it on a list and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it on wednesdays and fridays so i dont know i guess you could say this job is on my list and awkwardly smiling well see what rosa comes back with
erin,checks to see that she is alone with phyllis did you hear anything
phyllis,oh im sure theyll let us know when they get the results erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly
phyllis,it turns out that erin was born in the basic time and region that i gave away a child
erin,so phyllis might be my mom i mean the chances are tiny but
phyllis,but probably not i mean it was a big year for babies porkys had come out
erin,yeah im sure i was just another porkys baby
phyllis,mm
erin,but why not find out
phyllis,yeah
pam,to dwight who is reading the want ads should you really be so blatant about that
dwight,they wont make me manager and i wont settle for anything less ive gone about as far as i can here thats obvious time to take my talents elsewhere
pam,are you really going to apply for work at scranton breadworks
dwight,bread is the paper of the food industry you write your sandwich on it
warren buffett,can you do any better on salary
jim,unfortunately that range is set at corporate
erin,what about mileage when i use my car i mean gas aint cheap you know
jim,heh we think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous
erin,how about 27 and uh when i make longdistance calls will they be monitored or is it on the honor system
angela,on phone okay hangs up smiling how odd a very unusual phone call from the senators office the senator wants me to have lunch with him at the botanical gardens
kevin,the botanical gardens scrantons hidden gem dont eat any berries you dont recognize
toby,how will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here
robert,you dont work in sales do you
toby,uh human resources
robert,you see i sit across from a man i see his face i see his eyes now does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deepsea drilling equipment dont be a fool he wants respect he wants love he wants to be younger he wants to be attractive there is no such thing as a product dont ever think there is there is only sex everything is sex you understand that what im telling you is a universal truth toby
toby,yes
gabe,okay ii am im almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position robert and gabe chuckle at this then gabe stops chuckling do you um do you think that you are
robert,do i look like someone who would waste my own time
gabe,no robert then nods his head at jim
jim,can you seems intimidated clears throat you are a man of great confidence could you speak a little more to that and what the role of confidence would be in a dialogue with a subordinate
robert,will you be heard will you have a voice will i steamroll over you do you feel heard right now jim do you have a voice right now you can answer me
jim,yes
robert,that was your choice not mine the fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller it is up to the object whether it will be flattened or not and i can tell from the small interaction weve had already you wont be flattened by anybody do you agree with me jim
jim,yes
robert,more emphatically than jim yes you do nods at the search committee then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face
jim,robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves he creeps me out toby nods but i think he might be a genius
andy,jim points at darryl to be the next interviewee good luck darryl
darryl,pats andy on the back thank you
darryl,think about it what other mammal besides humans drinks the milk of another mammal i mean you dont see a bear drinking raccoon milk
jim,jim and gabe laugh toby smiles and nods oh
darryl,so this is cool i think we make a good fit stands up
gabe,oh uh we havent started the interview yet were youwere you joking
darryl,uh looks at camera yes i was sits back down little joke
toby,so how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office
darryl,i thought that was your job
toby,well its one of my strengths but its the managers job
jim,well for instance how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight
darryl,ill answer that jim i would use it as an opportunity to teach uh about actions and consequences of actions jim and gabe stare at darryl
darryl,noticing erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office whos that
jim,ignoring darryls question so i think all we need is a resume and well be good right
darryl,i i just thought you knew me
jim,yeah its no big deal just something that looks like that shows darryl a resume cool goes to put the resume away
darryl,let me jim shows him the resume again darryl looks at it a little longer this time oh cool jim gives darryl a thumbsup then looks at the camera as darryl gets up to leave
merv bronte,at the cafe on the first floor did uh you just interview
robert,ohh unfortunately yes
merv,what do you mean
robert,that business cant attract anyone its awful up there those people seem like theyre in prison waiting out life sentences in a dying industry
merv,place must be horrible i dont know if i want this job gets on elevator
merv,in elevator well if i get this job offer and then i know that im gonna take it and if i take it i know that im never gonna quit and then 25 years are gonna go by and im gonna die here
dwight,what makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview robert stares at dwight what are you doing dwight sits up abruptly stop trying to figure me out
robert,i just did
dwight,you cant
robert,its done
dwight,no its not
robert,i know you now your nature im done not worth continuing at the same time dwight says  you dont know me anything about me get out of my head
dwight,stop trying to figure me out robert turns to ignore dwight do you even know anything about paper how its made
robert,i saw an episode of how they make paper on sesame street nods at dwight mockingly
dwight,standing up get out
dwight,im gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak passionless leadership do you see my hat no thats because i just threw it in the ring
merv,you guys pay for relocation though right
toby,well why would you need relocation if you already live in scranton
merv,well id want to move further away you know just i dont want any chance to run into my coworkers outside the office
jim,can i ask why youre leaving your current job
merv,pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware im leaving my other job because they were all jerks really opens tupperware you know all of em you had your jerkwads and your jerkoffs so just between the wads and the offs i just i had to get outta there begins eating sandwich
jim,is this a bad time to be doing this
merv,im having a bad time chuckles
toby,im sorry if we did something to upset you im sure it was inadvertent
merv,continues to chew slower and slower appears confused wait
merv,oh why did i believe that weirdo in the lobby these are the nicest people i ever met
angela,limo driver lets angela out of the limo at the office parking lot thank you

walter,im not going to tell you how impressed i am that youre a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in scranton pennsylvania how long are you going to go on needing my approval youre a grown man dont act like a little boy who needs
darryl,i think if i had parents like that id be trying to convince everyone all the time how great i was too
oscar,guess we found andys rosebud
darryl,rosebud
oscar,its a reference to citizen kane something that explains why a person became the way they are
darryl,i know citizen kane rosebud didnt explain why he was how he was it just represented what was important to him as a child that he missed
oscar,different school of thought lets just agree to disagree
darryl,no youre wrong
robert,are you sure
ryan,yeah im too hot anyway

andy,well the monitoring software is a double edged sword sometimesâ€¦
dwight,runs in and interrupts sorry go ahead
robert,to dwight did you need something from us
dwight,whaâ€¦yes your attention uh becauseâ€¦ no that is all walks out
dwight,last night i dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world the vice president had all the power athletes fought for silver medals women were considered the best gender and stadiums of fans shouted were number two as with all my dreams im guessing it was about my fear of immigrants
robert,last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free

andy,what do you got
dwight,opens folder allow me youre going to love this struggles opening folder ughâ€¦shouldve used a shorter string never mind i know it by heart it is a system that holds people accountable for everyone elses work

andy,do not go there youre the deuce i never want to drop
dwight,well i can make this work ill set it up right now just need your go ahead

toby,good luck gabe
andy,hi guys i just wanted to say that you all have been doing amazing work really
kevin,thank you
andy,and id like to add that your work has been a little sloppy so dwight and i have implemented a new program that we like to callâ€¦dwightâ€¦
dwight,the accountability booster it registers every time a mistake has been made in the office from a late delivery to an accounting error five strikes in a day equals a home run one home run and youre out
andy,if we as a group make five mistakes in a day something bad happens like we block minesweeper
dwight,or in this case an email gets sent to robert california containing the consultants report from last year remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown and as a failsafe also every negative email youve ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him
kelly,what emails are you talking about
dwight,roberts favorite songs creep by tlc creep by radio head you remember that one jim there is no way he hasnt strangled at least one stripper oscar he eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him kelly
kelly,thats not that bad actually
dwight,ps we should should kill him
jim,wait so you installed a doomsday device
dwight,no its an accountability booster
jim,which when it goes off it destroys everything very similar to a doomsday device
dwight,jim youre trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other i am confident that you guys are equal to the task
kelly,um no were not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives
ryan,we cant do this dwight
dwight,everyone angrily disagreeingsmileâ€¦nod smile and nod
dwight,they are making me out to be a bond villian i like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world likeâ€¦not doctor moreau someone good doctor frankenstein doctor jekyll not them doctorâ€¦
andy,are you sure this is a good idea i mean the thing about this office is we make a lot of mistakes
dwight,but the device will change that without a safety net people will improve
andy,alright everybody looks like we need to be getting to work be extra careful double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha
stanley,this doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me
oscar,theres an easy way to tell if this device is a sham we just make a mistake ill send an order down to shipping before weve received payment
dwight,alert goes off oh theres one mistake
erin,now we only have four strikes left until a home run
andy,dwights our coworker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so iâ€¦
dwight,its not a doomsday device gosh erin makes red strike on desk we can do this you guys
warehouse guy,first second
darryl,its not a race

darryl,apparently we have a visitor gabe everyone
warehouse guy,hi gabe
darryl,all right so the support belt now this one is mine doesnt get much use nowadays

gabe,i get the sense that val enjoys a good putdown considering thats the only thing i know about her i will be milking that hard gestures milking a cow
gabe,its like a hula hoop right mele kalikimaka is the wise way
darryl,you done
gabe,the michelin man called he wants his cummerbund back
phyllis,remember we have to give rigo escrow their refund by five
kevin,im on it
angela,kevin maybe i should handle that we really need you to focus on your project
kevin,good thinking
kevin,apparently a big client for this company needs to know the story of how paper gets made
angela,oscar use a calculator oscar shakes head
oscar,when the stakes are this high there is only one computer that i trust and its powered by thai food and spanish reds points to his head
andy,alright everybody you are doing great
dwight,well i wouldnt say that three mistakes already is pretty terrible but i do see improvement meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look shes hard at work meredith gives dwight the finger
jim,dwight question
dwight,no questions
jim,if this doomsday device goes off
dwight,accountability booster
jim,if this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs are you going to feel good about that
dwight,i havent even considered it thats how sure i am that this accountability booster is going to work

phyllis,well this could be fun i
andy,yeah well the bus has free wifi and i made special lowsugar lunches for everyone and is anyone kosher or halal
ryan,whats the halal option
andy,dates tabbouleh and a bagel with cream cheese

darryl,you know i just got limitless on my ipad i bet i could get it on the tv
phyllis,ooh isnt that the one where the guy becomes limitless
andy,its just not appropri i mean if we were going to visit bradley coopers birthplace id be the first one suggesting it id be rooting for it

robert,where is everyone where is andy
kelly,andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to gettysburg
robert,well i was hoping to talk out some ideas with andy but what we have here is perhaps better by not going on the trip youve shown youre the freethinkers of the office
ryan,robert you got your sheep and you got your black sheep and im not even a sheep im on the freaking moon
robert,so here what we can do game changers changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again everyone brainstorm some innovations dont be afraid to get weird with it meredith wakes her up excited

jim,no of course were not tourists were just people that arent from here who are taking a tour
phyllis,yeah sign says begin tour here
andy,unless youre going on the very speciallycreated and meticulouslyresearched andy bernard tour
andy,after chancellorsville lee brought his army up the shenandoah valley right through here they stopped in this field for a picnic which they called lunch
erin,to dwight yeah but im confused
dwight,total deaths belongs to gettysburg but when youre talking about dpa thats deaths per acre
erin,mmhmm
dwight,nothing beats the battle of schrute farms
erin,oh dpa sounds way more important that total deaths
dwight,oh it is and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home i mean it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush laughs im telling you theyre heartbreaking too so beautifully written
oscar,dwight what are you telling this girl
dwight,the truth
oscar,stop filling her head with nonsense okay she doesnt know any better
erin,oscar i am so glad you just got here i wouldve believed everything he said
dwight,no no no youre filling her head with nonsense you and the history books im telling the truth
erin,interesting
dwight,yes thank you all of history has been whitewashed
oscar,really why dont you tell us the real history gore vidal
dwight,okay i will i dont know who that is but im gonna tell you this
oscar,hes a historian
dwight,gettysburg was very important credit where credit is due okay big mad props to gettysburg was it however the most northern battle of the civil war

robert,i am so eager to hear your gamechangers lets dig in shall we
ryan,may i go first
robert,absolutely
ryan,raw fish the disgusting food from japan that americans would never want to eat now we cant get enough of it from movie stars to construction workers sushi is whats for dinner let me throw another idea at you origami what the crazy art of paper folding from thats right japan dont you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in manhattan we can do that with origami its the sushi of paper
robert,this idea hasnt gripped me what else did you come up with
ryan,well i had to memorize the presentation robert and it took a long time to build the swan so
robert,that was bad
stanley,if your woman is like mine i bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time this paper is so hard it scratches why cant there be a paper just for me well now there is papyr paper for women its pink scented and silky soft now you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister
robert,the situation you described returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine is not one im familiar with
stanley,in the africanamerican community
robert,no
stanley,murmurs thought it was worth a try
darryl,thats fascinating tell me whats the significance of the peach orchard thought
park ranger,oh well thats a great question actually some of the most
dwight,excuse me i got a question for you
park ranger,sure
dwight,can you tell us about the battle of schrute farms
park ranger,uh i havent heard of that one
dwight,really okay followup question how much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut
oscar,i apologize for my friend and for the republicans who are cutting your funding
andy,we dont need to bother this poor gentleman i know exactly where were going giddy up tallyho
chelsea,taps gabes shoulder are you lincoln
gabe,no no im
gabe,apparently i bear a passing resemblance to abraham lincoln makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums historical monuments elementary schools i dont see it
chelseas mom,chelsea give mr lincoln your hat so i can take a picture
gabe,okay quick
jan,hey lincolns starting light applause
gabe,oh uh no no no no no im uh im actually with a tour group myself so laughter hello im abraham lincoln some people call me the great emancipator but uh you might know me from the penny laughter
pam,okay you know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools i was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us and as you know as i tell it i dont like it unless of course you are responding to it
robert,i am not
pam,um excuse me im gonna go to the bathroom
pam,at this point when youre this pregnant its kind of like senior spring the other day i spit my gum out on the carpet
robert,kevin youve been quiet im curious to know what your gamechanger is
kevin,well you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the a1 spot they do that cause they think a1s the best spot for the best cookie but the real best spot is d4 right thats where the eyes go so
robert,cookies cookie placement
kevin,yeah but not just the cookies though that was just a for instance
robert,who else agrees with kevin that were wasting facilities manpower on our underselling products when we should be pushing our topperformers everyone raises their hand robert laughs there you go consensus
ryan,okay we are now on a planet where kevin is the most creative person around and i am just some goodlooking guy
gabe,as lincoln i just dont understand its 1865 victory is ours ive saved the very soul of our nation and yet happiness eludes me oh perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits
attendant,no
kevin,kay so another thing about oatmeal cookies who even wants them i mean ive seen toby eat one like once but other than that scoffs like forget it
robert,interesting so what is dunder mifflins oatmeal cookie what is the product that no one wants
stanley,how about that twoholepunch letter only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal
robert,thats the oatmeal cookie fantastic kevin fantastic laughs
kevin,thank you
jim,by the way did we leave all the food on the bus
andy,lets talk about food for a second food for thought
jim,yeah thats what i had for breakfast and i think thats probably why im still hungry
andy,hunger hunger for victory hunger for honor hunger for pride
darryl,hunger for hamburger
erin,hunger for chicken chimichangas right darryl
darryl,thats good
andy,exactly now do you know the civil war soldiers were hungry for pride now each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives colonel harrison jeffords of the fourth michigan infantry saw his flag being carried away chased it down with nothing but a sword fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died he wasnt about to let them have that flag pride right guys holds up flag i commissioned this flag for dunder mifflin cost me two hundred dollars
jim,only two hundred dollars
andy,we are all branches on this tree and from the tree comes paper were all part of a business but business is war whats that i hear uh a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag wha whats going on here weehoo come and get it whos gonna get the flag whos getting it whoa hey ho dont look where i am look where im going juke right juke left
darryl,andy this is inappropriate people died here man
andy,get the flag get the flag come on big tuna what you gonna do about it we got a flag right here weehoo
andy,spangler springs is a mile this way
jim,oh wow  so thatâ€™s two miles if you incorporate the walk back
andy,itsâ€¦ i mean come on
phyllis,i donâ€™t think i should walk anymore  you know all i had for breakfast was oatmeal yogurt coffee orange juice and toast  two poached eggs  and then half a sandwich on the bus
andy,alright fine  you know what â€ i guess this place just hasnâ€™t rubbed off on you the way i hoped it would  iâ€™m still going  and iâ€™m not going to ask anymore  iâ€™m not even going to look back  iâ€™m just going to assume that youâ€™re with me
dwight,andy looks back to find everyone sitting you said you werenâ€™t going to look back
robert,and why is black rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared
kevin,i donâ€™t know
robert,right  i mean youâ€™re an accountant  those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane
kevin,yes  i am an accountant
oscar,dwight â€ this is one of the archivists here  i thought maybe we could consult him
dwight,really
oscar,yeah
dwight,well  anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms
archivist,schrute farms did you say  that is a fascinating little chapter of the civil war
oscar,youâ€™ve heard about it
dwight,yes  ha  prepare to be refuted  go on
archivist,there you go
narrator,families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front
soldier,dearest mother iâ€™m sorry it has been so long since my last letter  it is three months since i arrived at schrute farms and i fear i may never leave this place alive  melvin fifer garris
dwight,hallowed ground
narrator,but the battle at schrute farms was no battle at all  it was a code used by pacifists from both north and south who turned the pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war
amanda,on film you have to understand  poets artists dancers â€ these kind of men preferred peace to war  these delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the schrutes at schrute farms  amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight  i like to think of schrute farms as the underground railroad for the sensitiveâ€¦ and wellâ€¦ fabulous
oscar,wow  this is so much better than the story you made up
dwight,iâ€™ve seen enough
oscar,youâ€™re right  there should be a monument to this
kevin,never trust a cookie with a womanâ€™s name  pecan sandy  lorna doone  madeline  theyâ€™ll just break your heart
robert,laughing kevin
ryan,robert i hate to interrupt  but i would love to pitch you one last idea  i call it the big mac idea
kevin,what no
robert,big mac idea  that sounds encouraging
ryan,itâ€™s really really good robert  let me explain
kevin,no  this is not fair  this is my idea  heâ€™s trying to steal it because heâ€™s jealous of me
robert,well what is the idea
kevin,every time you buy a big mac you set one ingredient aside  then at the end of the week you have a free big mac  and you love it even more because you made it with your own hands
ryan,you know what  now i remember  that was your idea patting kevin on the back that is 100 percent your idea
robert,oh my  it was just actually cookies the whole time
andy,making pencil imprint dammit
darryl,hey
andy,you guys came  whereâ€™s everyone else
darryl,back at the bus  we were locked out  phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich
andy,yeah i asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there  i guess he follows orders
jim,yeah sorry everyone else didnâ€™t come  i think theyâ€™re just tired  with holes in their shoes  and they have dysentery
andy,even without an audience youâ€™re still at it
jim,what are you talking about
andy,our office has a disease  and it goes by many names  sarcasm  snark  wisecracks  you take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes  thatâ€™s what you did with this trip
dwight,knocks water bottle on to jims desk oh little help wow your hair is really thinning
dwight,standing is proven to be healthier increases productivity and just looks cooler picture someone doing something heroic now was he sitting or standing not counting fdr
dwight,every second you sit there is an hour off your life look at all of you i feel like youâ€™re in a suicide cult
creed,no no no youâ€™re way off on that one
dwight,oh yeah
oscar,are you really comfortable standing there i tried one of those and i just never hit the sweet spot
jim,hey guys letâ€™s just all admit it ok dwightâ€™s better than us he had the guts to stop sitting and heâ€™s never ever going to go back on it right
dwight,thatâ€™s right jim
darryl,hey man
dwight,jumping up from an almost sitting position hey
darryl,taking a load off huh
dwight,no putting a load on more like it
darryl,good luck with that
dwight,last thing i need is luck hunches down again
dwight,to angela thank you so much hums
jim,sees a pole poking out dwightâ€™s pant leg what are you up to oops look out grabs dwights wallet
dwight,what are you doing give that back come on
jim,prank throws money from dwightâ€™s wallet on the floor
dwight,oh thatâ€™s real creative
jim,you know what itâ€™s not my best because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right
dwight,i could but i just donâ€™t feel like it loser
jim,because youâ€™re sitting
dwight,standing
jim,ok
dwight,donâ€™t
jim,because youâ€™re sitting
dwight,standing
jim,you know i have to do this
dwight,i know jim pushes him over dwight screams
andy,signing his name andrewâ€¦ bainesâ€¦ bernard
jim,i think you could just do andy bernard
andy,andrew baines bernard i love filling these out because itâ€™s like taking a test but i know the answers
robert,loudly knocking on the window in four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door i told her she could work here under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen to mrs california there you are honey how on earth could you miss the elevator
andy,what was that
jim,i donâ€™t know he wasnâ€™t talking to me but if i were you i wouldnâ€™t hire his wife
ryan,thatâ€™s why my foundation â€ the dream for a wish foundation â€ is going to put them out of business theyâ€™re not going to know what hit them
robert,everyone iâ€™d like to introduce my wife mrs robert california mrs california this is everyone

robert,andy would you be so kind as to show susan around the office show her the various departments find a place where sheâ€™ll shine
andy,i would love to but i have to be completely honest with you guys weâ€™re 100 percent staffed up
robert,andy letâ€™s see if thereâ€™s a good fit first then weâ€™ll talk
andy,alright
dwight,knock knock knock knock knock
darryl,you donâ€™t have to say it if youâ€™re doing it
dwight,laughs remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics
darryl,uh weight lifting yeah
dwight,well todayâ€™s your lucky day i have opened in this very office building dwight schruteâ€™s gym for muscles you wanna take a look
darryl,iâ€™ll take a look
dwight,your path from obesity begins right here
darryl,iâ€™ve been meaning to join a gym narrating over a montage of scenes with him and val for my health i used to say i wanted to live long enough to see a black president i didnâ€™t realize how easy that would be so now i want to live long enough to see a really really gay president or a supermodel president i want to see all the different kinds of presidents
dwight,obese people in my office are a drain on resources chairs wear out faster it takes more freon to keep them cool they flush the toilets more often plus their massive bms bust the rivets on my pipes but a gym turns fat into cash
andy,alright the dm express is pulling out
susan,well it was really nice to meet you brian
ryan,actually ryan
susan,oh ryan
ryan,bitttch
andy,we will start here at erinville
susan,hi
erin,hoohoo
andy,reception your classic oneman operation
erin,although i was watching a movie and merryl streep had two secretaries
andy,i was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over san francisco just saying
robert,two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients certainly worth exploring wouldnâ€™t you agree andy
andy,iâ€™ll explore exploring it
robert,good it seems like you have this under control so iâ€™ll just duck out and run the company for a while
andy,ok uh next stop on the tour sales here we go station stop jim halpert oh boy our resident truth teller jim laughs nervously alright have at it let â€˜er rip what do you hate about this place
jim,well itâ€™s sales so you have to be able to live in the world of rejection
dwight,maybe you do hi iâ€™m dwight sales is really not so hard ok itâ€™s paper we have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it
andy,jim
jim,well itâ€™s not that easy itâ€™s kind of sometimes difficult
dwight,itâ€™s the second easiest job in the world to camera being a mom
susan,i love shopping and sales is just the other side of that
dwight,that is true
andy,you know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head mr dwight schrute
dwight,thatâ€™s me
andy,dwight why donâ€™t you tell susan about some of your hobbies survival skills ranking of animals
dwight,maybe over a beer after sheâ€™s closed her first sale makes gun click noise
susan,well make that a red wine and iâ€™ll tell you my animal rankings makes gun click noise back
andy,oh how am i supposed to pull this off montage of office workers in friendly interactions with susan the entire office is being nice to her than theyâ€™ve ever been to me what i wouldnâ€™t give for one of phyllisâ€™ classic room clearing farts right now
dwight,ready what do you think
darryl,um no this is not a gym this is like a scene out of saw 5
dwight,you havenâ€™t even looked around yet look gravel bucket squat yoke squats grunts and lifts right dedicated phone book ripping station tries and fails to tear a phone book in half you ever cut tin before five yards in and your forearms will be on fire plus i will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard now letâ€™s go over membership iâ€™m going to need the first monthâ€™s and the last monthâ€™s up front $49 per month but every third month is $59 a month but the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per monthâ€¦
darryl,obviously you know how a gym works so you know iâ€™m not going to pay money for this you want people to come to your gym make a real gym
dwight,darryl picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire
darryl,make a real gym
susan,i was thinking accounting might be a good fit because i really clicked with oscar and i do have some experience in bookkeeping
andy,but we already have a surplus of accountants as it is
susan,uh i could work in customer service hr even
andy,those are fully staffed as well
robert,are you telling me that thereâ€™s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands
andy,laughing nervously yes
robert,i am the ceo and i am telling an employee of mine what to do
andy,let me beat around the bush for a second our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about
susan,robert this is very uncomfortable obviously thereâ€™s no place for me here so thank you for trying why donâ€™t we just let it go
robert,no absolutely not andrew there must be something you can do think
andy,there are lots of considerations

dwight,shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical what does this mean
ryan,i can field this one
dwight,no sit down seasonal well the christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one backtoschool is as well and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit but shopping is also cyclical the menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes you see during ovulation a womans only goal is to get pregnant and during menses she is sad that she has failed and how does the woman console herself shopping shopping just jim could you fetch me some ice chips thank you just gonna take a brief pause at this point jim gives dwight a bowl of ice chips thank you dwight sticks his head in the bowl oh god next slide

andy,how could i have been more clear he had a massive stroke slight pause of good fortune and he is now in a better place
phyllis,if dwights not coming back does that mean we can open his treasure
oscar,you guys weve gone over this there is no treasure erin retrieves the treasure box and slams it down on dwights desk
oscar,when the team left for tallahassee dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure cut to dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office dont touch my treasure ok you understand obviously he wants us to obsess about it theres nothing in there has realization which is obviously what he would want us to think making it the perfect place to hide a treasure oh god im wallace shawn in the princess bride
andy,i think that dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure everyone disagrees
oscar,i am dying to know whats in there
andy,yeah i know oscar we all are but nobodys gonna open it youd have to be insane everyone turns to look at creed
creed,hi hello

nellie,no
robert,im sorry
andy,this is what i was trying to tell you
robert,im not accustomed to people saying no to me laughs
nellie,well bobby get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes
robert,youre both adults im sure you can figure this out between yourselves
robert,i never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision so i find it best to excuse myself temporarily until ive had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally buffett operates the same way
nellie,im gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office im going to dock your pay one hundred dollars
andy,chuckling okay
nellie,five four
andy,you cant dock my pay

andy,youre just saying numbers its meaningless
nellie,three
andy,its literally like
nellie,two andy runs out of the room one
erin,there you go helps andy in the car hey were gonna have a nice hot date
erin,hey so last night was so not a big deal
andy,oh yeah i was just tired
erin,we both were plus i was definitely not my normal sexy self
andy,whoa no are you kidding you were so sexy just the thought of you last night like crazy turns me on it just didnt last night
erin,really its not a big deal
andy,yeah i know its not a big deal
ryan,i found this the other day while i was journaling and they reminded me of you
kelly,oh those are from our weekend at the time share
ryan,yeah the fractional ownership property sigh oh we took this one right before we got in that huge fight
kelly,god i dont even remember what that fight was about
ryan,you were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner but all i remember is how pretty you looked taking those pictures of me anyway if you want to order prints of your own i can send you the link
ryan,im in love with kelly kapoor and i dont know how im gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that but i do know that right here right now all i can think about is spending the rest of my life with her again that could change
erin,when you lost the manager job
dwight,yes
erin,did it affect you outside of the office
dwight,how
erin,i dont know what the technical term is penial softiosis
dwight,erin i am so glad that you trusted me you came to the exact right person for this no i have never once experienced anything remotely like that never
erin,oh okay
dwight,okay
erin,okay
dwight,washington monument
erin,oh
dwight,eiffel tower
erin,okay okay
pam,i saw you were getting along with ryan again
kelly,hes so sweet he pointed to my latte and he said kelly that will be the color of our children
pam,yeah hes so great remember how it felt when he cheated on you though
kelly,which time
pam,i am not going to let kelly throw her life away on ryan and it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician why you would even ask or were going to ask because i i felt like that question was coming
dwight,one of tobys eyes is getting smaller so theres that gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and meredith said she was interested and then gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket so ill keep you posted on that
dwight,every day i brief nellie on whats going on in the office most of its irrelevant but a good informer doesnt judge whats worth passing on
dwight,oh and andy lost his masculinity so congratulations on that
nellie,what do you mean
dwight,erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night by contrast i went to sleep with an erection so large it was like i was wearing no blanket at all wow i knew youd win but you just demolished him im a little bit jealous actually reduced him to a mere ant
nellie,i just wanted to take the mans job not his manhood
nellie,okay i would like to invite everyone into the conference room
andy,you cant call a meeting laughs but i would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now so lets get in the conference room thank you good thank you for coming to my meeting
nellie,okay if you would like to take a seat we can get started
andy,oh cant do it cause i gotta run a meeting so
nellie,no
andy,wanted to talk to all of you guys about reads whiteboard importance and know that each and every one of you is vitally important
robert,andrew not everyone here is important and the word is impotence
nellie,which is important in its own way so if youd just like to take a seat andy
nellie,take a mans job but leave him his balls margaret thatcher said that probably dont know dont read didnt see the movie
nellie,this meeting is not about any one person in particular it is a human problem
dwight,its not just a human problem flounders frequently experience impotence especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male
oscar,nellie does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular
nellie,oh oh its not me no no ive never had any problem in that arena and i have been with several older men
robert,in unison how old
creed,jinx buy me some coke
nellie,dwight told me about it earlier
erin,dwight

kevin,dwight couldnt get it up for nellie
dwight,no no no no no its not me im gonna prove it right here and now thrusts his pelvis
angela,what are you doing
oscar,what is this
angela,stop that dwight stop that stop it
andy,fine it was me i couldnt i had a problem with erin last night happy
andy,i had a lot on my mind last night and i didnt perform okay it happens to plenty of guys its usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview
andy,every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction tuna tdog
jim,um
darryl,uh i have other issues im terrible at math overweight you youre in great shape a lot better shape than i am tell you what
robert,it seems andy is the only one with this problem fascinating
andy,fascinating
gabe,i dont really see what the problem is erin doesnt even like sex remember you said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton
nellie,chumbo come on help me out any problems with little chumbo
kevin,tiptop shape
nellie,oh stanley
stanley,no umum
nellie,creed you are a thousand years old

gabe,ive read and i dont know anything about this personally but they say prostate stimulation can help
angela,ugh
gabe,this is just uh this american life i think i heard it on
robert,no thats absolutely the case
gabe,i know right
dwight,you know my rectal electroejaculator is rated for bovine use only but i could let you rent it
robert,andy why dont you tell us about the best erection of your life or does anyone else have any remarkable erections theyd like to share creed kevin and meredith raise their hands
kevin,ooh ooh
jim,wow what are we talking about
erin,toby doesnt hr have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff
toby,erin hr is a joke i cant do anything about anything
nellie,the most important thing to remember is not to stress about this stress just makes it worse and then you stress more and thats a vicious spiral
robert,i almost didnt come in today laughs
andy,on the phone dad dont think of it as a demotion just think of it as a promotion to a lower level i dont think you have to tell your friends anything it hasnt been decided yet
nellie,erin on phone memos youre writing the date american style month day year i prefer it day month year small bigger biggest oh sexual innuendo not intentional
erin,shut up shut up i am sick of your dumb opinions and if you dont like the way that i take phone messages here throws phone take em yourself
andy,oh and another thing our sex life is none of your businesses
erin,and andy is the manager not nellie
andy,stop protecting me im a man i can protect myself this is misdirected anger and im sorry i dont mean to lash out at you theres a lot coming up right now all at once into phone dad go to hell im taller than you
nellie,okay just calm down
andy,you are not the manager i earned that job i was personally chosen after robert was chosen and quit
robert,andy why dont you just take a seat
andy,why dont you take a seat you idiot throws chair
erin,and why dont you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels
andy,and your stupid face grabs nellies photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground and your stupid office punches hole in the wall ah
darryl,he does not like that wall
erin,maybe well get sent to anger management together
andy,that would actually be cool id love for you to meet some of the guys
robert,andy erin you can join us now
ryan,hey i hear you been badmouthing me to kelly

ryan,well thats your opinion and its her opinion but its not my opinion if you have something bad to say to me pam say it to my face
pam,fair enough um i dont think youre a very good person and forgive me but i feel like ive said this to you before i dont like you very much

ryan,this poem would crush you
oscar,ryan go away she found herself a beautiful boyfriend
kevin,yeah man hes absolutely gorgeous please leave her alone
ryan,you see kelly our love scares them it screws up their cookiecutter world

nellie,will you join me then in a pledge to live by taliban law in this office offers dwight a contract
dwight,takes contract absolutely i will
dwight,i feared nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font huh in a fake english accent you dont have a plan

nellie,oh this is a lovely pen ah but its mine now because i stole it
dwight,taking pen back gimme that
nellie,didnt you sign a contract to live under taliban law and now theres been theft that means youre not serious or someones getting their hand cut off

dwight,oh and let your precious operation power grab proceed unchecked no thank you
nellie,in that case you pulls out a cleaver will have to chop off my hand
dwight,considers then takes cleaver this cleaver appears to need sharpening i suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand tie a shoe toss a salad do any of the two hand activities that youll miss the most
nellie,i tell you what i need to make three calls and then after that you can become a person who chops off peoples hands
dwight,sounds like a plan

all,clapping
katy,singing â€˜faithâ€™
andy,no do not sing that do not oh man
hct member 3,he reminded us today of how much he means to us and we certainly seem to mean a lot to him so without any further ado hereâ€™s an old treble classic
katy,singing â€˜faithâ€™
broccoli rob,on flat screen tv singing lead of faith
andy,whoa whoa what the hell is broccoli rob doing here
hct member 3,she said you wanted to hear â€˜faithâ€™ thatâ€™s broccoli robâ€™s signature song
andy,thatâ€™s my signature song
hct member 3,i really didnâ€™t know that man i just thought you wanted to hear it
andy,russell iâ€™m dressed like george michael
hct member 3,i thought you were adam lambert
andy,wha
erin,the more i hear about all this a capella drama the more i think itâ€™s kind of pathetic but when youâ€™re with someone you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them and that is love
erin,are you okay
broccoli rob,on screen heâ€™s still mad
andy,shut up broccoli
broccoli rob,champ i feel awful about this whole thing russell called me up and they said they needed 20 ccâ€™s of george michael stat so just wham i sprang into action you know me i assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number
andy,you thought i wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty treb rat a manâ€™s signature solo is his for life okay thatâ€™s group policy and you know it
broccoli rob,look itâ€™s not my fault that i still live near campus and itâ€™s my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys and stop in two three times a week
andy,just donâ€™t do the song anymore
broccoli rob,i tell you what weâ€™ll have a singoff for it you pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and iâ€™ll do the same and iâ€™m so confident that iâ€™ll win i wonâ€™t even warm up
andy,fine go ahead thrash your pipes
broccoli rob,my pipes are primo champ why donâ€™t you ask trey anastasio about my pipes
andy,i knew you would go there you son of a bitch
broccoli rob,he said and i quote â€˜hey rob nice pipesâ€™ that happened
andy,ok fine yeah thatâ€™s one guyâ€™s opinion
broccoli rob,thats real  thatâ€™ll never change
erin,okay
andy,doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re the best singer ever dick
jim,i thought that concert was pretty great
kevin,oh yeah i decided that acapelca music is awesome
angela,they lost me when they sang â€˜monster mashâ€™ that song obviously glorifies the occult
jim,angela itâ€™s halloween you have to sing â€˜monster mashâ€™
pam,oh you have to jim you literally have to
jim,uh
pam,no iâ€™m just iâ€™m saying what would happen if they didnâ€™t sing it would they go to jail would they be shot
jim,okay weâ€™ll just forget it
pam,no no iâ€™m interested i mean i think everybodyâ€™s interested in why they have to sing it
jim,because it is halloween so if youâ€™re going to sing a concert itâ€™s a good idea to throw that one in
pam,yeah yeah no no itâ€™s a good idea to brush your teeth but you have to um feed your children send them to school you know all things you canâ€™t do if you just keep singing â€˜monster mashâ€™
kevin,it turns out that pam really really hates â€˜monster mashâ€™ i mean like never bring that song up in front of her even though jim was making great points like in favor of the song pam was like no hate it stupid
andy,this is all so silly right what am i gonna do move back to cornell
